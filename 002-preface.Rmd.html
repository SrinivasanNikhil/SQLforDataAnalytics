<h1 class="unnumbered">Preface</h1>
<p>This is not your traditional database textbook. It differs in three fundamental ways.</p>
<p><em>First</em>, it is deeper than most database books in its coverage of data modeling and SQL. The market seeks graduates who have these fundamental skills. Time and again, students who have completed my data management class have told me how these skills have been invaluable in their first and subsequent jobs. The book places great emphasis on the core skills of data management. Consequently, there is a better match between the skills you develop and those the market needs. This means you will find this text highly relevant.</p>
<p><em>Second</em>, the treatments of data modeling and SQL are intertwined because my database teaching experience indicates that students more readily understand the purpose of data modeling when they grasp the long-term goal—querying a well-designed relational database. The double helix, upward, intertwined, spiraling of data modeling and SQL is a unique pedagogical feature. Classroom testing indicates it is a superior method of teaching compared to handling data modeling and SQL separately. You will quickly understand the reason for data modeling and appreciate why it is a valuable skill. Also, rapid exposure to SQL means you gain hands-on experience more quickly.</p>
<p><em>Third</em>, the book is broader than most database books. Databases are one component of an expansive organizational memory. You need to develop a wide perspective of data management if you are to comprehend fully the organizational role of information systems.</p>
<p>In essence, the book is deeper where it matters—data modeling and SQL—and broader to give you a managerial outlook and an understanding of the latest technological advancements. Information is a key resource for modern organizations. It is a critical input to managerial tasks. Because managers need high-quality information to manage change in a turbulent, global environment, nearly every organizations has established systems for storing and retrieving data, the raw material of information. These storage and retrieval systems are an organization’s memory. The organization relies on them, just as individuals rely on their personal memory, to be able to continue as a going concern.</p>
<p>The central concern of information systems management is to design, build, and maintain information delivery systems. Information systems managemers needs to discover their organization’s information requirements, which includes the needs of its customers, so that it can design systems to serve these demands. It must merge a system’s design and information technology to build applications that provide the organization and its customers with data in a timely manner, appropriate formats, and at convenient locations. Furthermore, it must manage applications so they evolve to meet changing needs, continue to operate under adverse conditions, and are protected from unauthorized access.</p>
<p>An information delivery system has two components: data and processes. This book concentrates on data, which is customarily thought of as a database. I deliberately set out to extend this horizon, however, by including all forms of organizational data stores because I believe you need to understand the role of data management that is aligned with current practice. In my view, data management is the design and maintenance of computer-based organizational memory. Thus, you will find chapters on XML and organizational intelligence technologies.</p>
<p>The decision to start the book with a managerial perspective arises from the observation that successful information systems practice is based on matching managerial needs, social system constraints, and technical opportunities in an ecologically sound way. I want you to appreciate the big picture before you become immersed in the intricacies of data modeling and SQL.</p>
<p>The second section of the book provides in-depth coverage of data modeling and SQL. Data modeling is the foundation of database quality. A solid grounding in data modeling principles and extensive practice are necessary for successful database design. In addition, this section exposes you to the full power of SQL.</p>
<p>I intend this book to be a long-term investment. There are useful reference sections for data modeling and SQL. The data modeling section details the standard structures and their relational mappings. The SQL section contains an extensive list of queries that serves as a basis for developing other SQL queries. The purpose of these sections is to facilitate pattern matching. For example, if you have an SQL query that is similar to a previous problem you can rapidly search the SQL reference section to find the closest match. You can then use the model answer as a guide to formulating the SQL query for the problem at hand. These reference sections are another unique teaching feature that will serve you well during the course and in your career.</p>
<p>The third section has chapters on R, a statistics and graphics package, which provides the foundation necessary for the chapters on data visualization, text mining, cluster computing, and dashboards. These chapters provide you with the skills they need to work in topical areas such as data analytics. The third section, Advanced Data Management, which also covers spatial and temporal data, XML, and organizational intelligence, and greaph databases</p>
<p>The fourth and final section examines the management of organizational data stores. It covers data structures and storage, data processing architectures, SQL and Java, data integrity, and data administration.</p>
<p>As a result of completing this text you will</p>
<ul>
<li><p>have a broad, managerial perspective of an organization’s need for a memory;</p></li>
<li><p>be able to design and create a relational database;</p></li>
<li><p>be able to formulate complex SQL queries;</p></li>
<li><p>be able to use R to create data visualizations, mine text data, write an R script for big data problems, and create dashboards;</p></li>
<li><p>understand the purpose of XML and be able to design an XML schema, prepare an XML document, and write an XML stylesheet;</p></li>
<li><p>be able to use Cypher to query a graph database</p></li>
<li><p>have a sound understanding of database architectures and their managerial implications;</p></li>
<li><p>be familiar with the full range of technologies available for organizational memory;</p></li>
<li><p>be able to write a Java program to create a table from a CSV file and process a transaction;</p></li>
<li><p>understand the fundamentals of data administration;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>My goal is to give you a data management text that is innovative, relevant, and lively. I trust that you will enjoy learning about managing data in today’s organization.</p>
