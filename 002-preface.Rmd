# Preface {.unnumbered}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is not your traditional database textbook. It differs in three
fundamental ways.

*First*, it is deeper than most database books in its coverage of data
modeling and SQL. The market seeks graduates who have these fundamental
skills. Time and again, students who have completed my data management
class have told me how these skills have been invaluable in their first
and subsequent jobs. The intention is to place great emphasis on the
core skills of data management. The consequence is that there is a
better match between the skills students develop and those the market
needs. This means that students find this text highly relevant.

*Second*, the treatments of data modeling and SQL are intertwined
because my database teaching experience indicates that students more
readily understand the intent of data modeling when they grasp the
long-term goal---querying a well-designed relational database. The
double helix, upward, intertwined, spiraling of data modeling and SQL is
a unique pedagogical feature. Classroom testing indicates it is a
superior method of teaching compared to handling data modeling and SQL
separately. Students quickly understand the reason for data modeling and
appreciate why it is a valuable skill. Also, rapid exposure to SQL means
students gain hands-on experience more quickly.

*Third*, the book is broader than most database books. Databases are one
component of an expansive organizational memory. Information systems
professionals need to develop a wide perspective of data management if
they are to comprehend fully the organizational role of information
systems.

In essence, the book is deeper where it matters---data modeling and
SQL---and broader to give students a managerial outlook and an
understanding of the latest technological advancements. Information is a
key resource for modern organizations. It is a critical input to
managerial tasks. Because managers need high-quality information to
manage change in a turbulent, global environment, many organizations
have established systems for storing and retrieving data, the raw
material of information. These storage and retrieval systems are an
organization's memory. The organization relies on them, just as
individuals rely on their personal memory, to be able to continue as a
going concern.

The central concern of information systems management is to design,
build, and maintain information delivery systems. Information systems
management needs to discover its organization's information
requirements, which includes the needs of its customers, so that it can
design systems to serve these demands. It must merge a system's design
and information technology to build applications that provide the
organization and its customers with data in a timely manner, appropriate
formats, and at convenient locations. Furthermore, it must manage
applications so they evolve to meet changing needs, continue to operate
under adverse conditions, and are protected from unauthorized access.

An information delivery system has two components: data and processes.
This book concentrates on data, which is customarily thought of as a
database. I deliberately set out to extend this horizon, however, by
including all forms of organizational data stores because I believe
students need to understand the role of data management that is aligned
with current practice. In my view, data management is the design and
maintenance of computer-based organizational memory. Thus, you will find
chapters on XML and organizational intelligence technologies.

The decision to start the book with a managerial perspective arises from
the belief that successful information systems practice is based on
matching managerial needs, social system constraints, and technical
opportunities in an ecologically sound way. I want readers to appreciate
the big picture before they become immersed in the intricacies of data
modeling and SQL.

The second section of the book provides in-depth coverage of data
modeling and SQL. Data modeling is the foundation of database quality. A
solid grounding in data modeling principles and extensive practice are
necessary for successful database design. In addition, this section
exposes students to the full power of SQL.

I intend this book to be a long-term investment. There are useful
reference sections for data modeling and SQL. The data modeling section
details the standard structures and their relational mappings. The SQL
section contains an extensive list of queries that serves as a basis for
developing other SQL queries. The purpose of these sections is to
facilitate pattern matching. For example, a student with an SQL query
that is similar to a previous problem can rapidly search the SQL
reference section to find the closest match. The student can then use
the model answer as a guide to formulating the SQL query for the problem
at hand. These reference sections are another unique teaching feature
that will serve students well during the course and in their careers.

The third section has chapters on R, a statistics and graphics package,
which provides the foundation necessary for the new chapters on data
visualization, text mining, cluster computing, and dashboards. These
chapters provide today's students with the skills they need to work in
topical areas such as social media analytics and big data. These
chapters are included in this third section, Advanced Data Management,
which also covers spatial and temporal data, XML, and organizational
intelligence.

The fourth and final section examines the management of organizational
data stores. It covers data structures and storage, data processing
architectures, SQL and Java, data integrity, and data administration.

A student completing this text will

-   have a broad, managerial perspective of an organization's need for a
    memory;

-   be able to design and create a relational database;

-   be able to formulate complex SQL queries;

-   be able to use R to create data visualizations, mine text data,
    write an R script for big data problems, and create dashboards;

-   understand the purpose of XML and be able to design an XML schema,
    prepare an XML document, and write an XML stylesheet;

-   have a sound understanding of database architectures and their
    managerial implications;

-   be familiar with the full range of technologies available for
    organizational memory;

-   be able to write a Java program to create a table from a CSV file
    and process a transaction;

-   understand the fundamentals of data administration;

My goal is to give the reader a data management text that is innovative,
relevant, and lively. I trust that you will enjoy learning about
managing data in today's organization.
