\section*{Preface}\label{preface}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Preface}

\emph{Editors Note} This is the original preface of the text written by
the author ``Richard Watson''. I am leaving this preface in place to
keep the specific acknowledgements made in this document. Not all of the
content in this preface applies to this version of the text for the SQL
for Data Analytics course.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

This is not your traditional database textbook. It differs in three
fundamental ways.

\emph{First}, it is deeper than most database books in its coverage of
data modeling and SQL. The market seeks graduates who have these
fundamental skills. Time and again, students who have completed my data
management class have told me how these skills have been invaluable in
their first and subsequent jobs. The book places great emphasis on the
core skills of data management. Consequently, there is a better match
between the skills you develop and those the market needs. This means
you will find this text highly relevant.

\emph{Second}, the treatments of data modeling and SQL are intertwined
because my database teaching experience indicates that students more
readily understand the purpose of data modeling when they grasp the
long-term goal---querying a well-designed relational database. The
double helix, upward, intertwined, spiraling of data modeling and SQL is
a unique pedagogical feature. Classroom testing indicates it is a
superior method of teaching compared to handling data modeling and SQL
separately. You will quickly understand the reason for data modeling and
appreciate why it is a valuable skill. Also, rapid exposure to SQL means
you gain hands-on experience more quickly.

\emph{Third}, the book is broader than most database books. Databases
are one component of an expansive organizational memory. You need to
develop a wide perspective of data management if you are to comprehend
fully the organizational role of information systems.

In essence, the book is deeper where it matters---data modeling and
SQL---and broader to give you a managerial outlook and an understanding
of the latest technological advancements. Information is a key resource
for modern organizations. It is a critical input to managerial tasks.
Because managers need high-quality information to manage change in a
turbulent, global environment, nearly every organizations has
established systems for storing and retrieving data, the raw material of
information. These storage and retrieval systems are an organization's
memory. The organization relies on them, just as individuals rely on
their personal memory, to be able to continue as a going concern.

The central concern of information systems management is to design,
build, and maintain information delivery systems. Information systems
managemers needs to discover their organization's information
requirements, which includes the needs of its customers, so that it can
design systems to serve these demands. It must merge a system's design
and information technology to build applications that provide the
organization and its customers with data in a timely manner, appropriate
formats, and at convenient locations. Furthermore, it must manage
applications so they evolve to meet changing needs, continue to operate
under adverse conditions, and are protected from unauthorized access.

An information delivery system has two components: data and processes.
This book concentrates on data, which is customarily thought of as a
database. I deliberately set out to extend this horizon, however, by
including all forms of organizational data stores because I believe you
need to understand the role of data management that is aligned with
current practice. In my view, data management is the design and
maintenance of computer-based organizational memory. Thus, you will find
chapters on XML and organizational intelligence technologies.

The decision to start the book with a managerial perspective arises from
the observation that successful information systems practice is based on
matching managerial needs, social system constraints, and technical
opportunities in an ecologically sound way. I want you to appreciate the
big picture before you become immersed in the intricacies of data
modeling and SQL.

The second section of the book provides in-depth coverage of data
modeling and SQL. Data modeling is the foundation of database quality. A
solid grounding in data modeling principles and extensive practice are
necessary for successful database design. In addition, this section
exposes you to the full power of SQL.

I intend this book to be a long-term investment. There are useful
reference sections for data modeling and SQL. The data modeling section
details the standard structures and their relational mappings. The SQL
section contains an extensive list of queries that serves as a basis for
developing other SQL queries. The purpose of these sections is to
facilitate pattern matching. For example, if you have an SQL query that
is similar to a previous problem you can rapidly search the SQL
reference section to find the closest match. You can then use the model
answer as a guide to formulating the SQL query for the problem at hand.
These reference sections are another unique teaching feature that will
serve you well during the course and in your career.

The third section has chapters on R, a statistics and graphics package,
which provides the foundation necessary for the chapters on data
visualization, text mining, cluster computing, and dashboards. These
chapters provide you with the skills they need to work in topical areas
such as data analytics. The third section, Advanced Data Management,
which also covers spatial and temporal data, XML, and organizational
intelligence, and greaph databases

The fourth and final section examines the management of organizational
data stores. It covers data structures and storage, data processing
architectures, SQL and Java, data integrity, and data administration.

As a result of completing this text you will

\begin{itemize}
\item
  have a broad, managerial perspective of an organization's need for a
  memory;
\item
  be able to design and create a relational database;
\item
  be able to formulate complex SQL queries;
\item
  be able to use R to create data visualizations, mine text data, write
  an R script for big data problems, and create dashboards;
\item
  understand the purpose of XML and be able to design an XML schema,
  prepare an XML document, and write an XML stylesheet;
\item
  be able to use Cypher to query a graph database
\item
  have a sound understanding of database architectures and their
  managerial implications;
\item
  be familiar with the full range of technologies available for
  organizational memory;
\item
  be able to write a Java program to create a table from a CSV file and
  process a transaction;
\item
  understand the fundamentals of data administration;
\end{itemize}

My goal is to give you a data management text that is innovative,
relevant, and lively. I trust that you will enjoy learning about
managing data in today's organization.

\begin{quote}
\emph{It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.}

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, ``A Scandal in Bohemia,'' \emph{The Adventures
of Sherlock Holmes}, 1891
\end{quote}

The application backlog, a large number of requests for new information
systems, has been a recurring problem in many organizations for decades.
The demand for new information systems and the need to maintain existing
systems have usually outstripped available information systems skills.
The application backlog, unfortunately, is not a new problem. In the
1970s, Codd laid out a plan for improving programmer productivity and
accelerating systems development by improving the management of data.
Codd's \textbf{relational model}, designed to solve many of the
shortcomings of earlier systems, has long been the most popular database
model.

A collection of related files is a \textbf{database}. Describing the
collection of files as related means that it has a common purpose (e.g.,
data about students). Sometimes files are also called tables, and there
are synonyms for some other terms (the alternative names are shown in
parentheses). Files contain \textbf{records} (or rows). Each record
contains the data for one instance of an observation. For example, if
the file stores data about students, each record will contain data about
a single student. Records have \textbf{fields} (or columns) that store
the fine detail of each instance (e.g., student's first name, last name,
and date of birth). Fields are composed of \textbf{characters} (a, b,
c,.., 1, 2, 3,\ldots, \%, \$, \#,\ldots, A, B, etc.). A \textbf{byte}, a
unit of storage sufficient to store a single letter (in English),
consists of a string of eight contiguous \textbf{bits} or binary digits.

The data management hierarchy stimulates three database design
questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  What collection of files should the database contain?
\item
  How are these files related?
\item
  What fields should each record in the file contain?
\end{itemize}

The first objective of this section is to describe data modeling, a
technique for answering the three questions. Data modeling helps you to
understand the structure and meaning of data, which is necessary before
a database can be created. Once a database has been designed, built, and
loaded with data, the aim is to deploy it to satisfy management's
requests for information. Thus, the second objective is to teach you to
query a relational database. The learning of modeling and querying will
be intertwined, making it easier to grasp the intent of database design
and to understand why data modeling is so critical to making a database
an effective tool for managerial decision making.

Chapter 1 covers modeling a single entity and querying a single-table
database. This is the simplest database that can be created. As you will
soon discover, a \textbf{data model} is a graphical description of the
components of a database. One of these components is an entity, some
feature of the real world about which data must be stored. This section
also introduces the notions of a \textbf{data definition language}
(DDL), which is used to describe a database, and a \textbf{data
manipulation language} (DML), which is used to maintain and query a
database. Subsequent chapters in this section cover advanced concepts
and querying capabilities.

\hypertarget{the-relational-model}{%
\subsection{The relational model}\label{the-relational-model}}

The relational model introduced by Codd in 1970 is the most popular
technology for managing large collections of data. In this chapter, the
major concepts of the relational model are introduced. Extensive
coverage of the relational model is left until Chapter 8, by which time
you will have sufficient practical experience to appreciate fully its
usefulness, value, and elegance.

A \textbf{relation}, similar to the mathematical concept of a set, is a
two-dimensional table arranged in rows and columns. This is a very
familiar idea. You have been using tables for many years. A
\textbf{relational database} is a collection of relations, where
\textbf{relation} is a mathematical term for a table. One row of a table
stores details of one observation, instance, or case of an item about
which facts are retained---for example, one row for details of a
particular student. All the rows in a table store data about the same
type of item. Thus, a database might have one table for student data and
another table for class data. Similarly, each column in the table
contains the same type of data. For example, the first column might
record a student's identification number. A key database design question
is to decide what to store in each table. What should the rows and
columns contain?

In a relational database, each row must be uniquely identified. There
must be a \textbf{primary key}, such as student identifier, so that a
particular row can be designated. The use of unique identifiers is very
common. Telephone numbers and e-mail addresses are examples of unique
identifiers. Selection of the primary key, or unique identifier, is
another key issue of database design.

\begin{quote}
💠 \textbf{Global legal entity identifier (LEI)}

There is no global standard for identifying legal entities across
markets and jurisdictions. The need for such a standard was amplified by
Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008. Lehman had 209 registered
subsidiaries, legal entities, in 21 countries, and it was party to more
than 900,000 derivatives contracts upon its collapse. Key stakeholders,
such as financial regulators and Lehman's creditors, were unable to
assess their exposure. Furthermore, others were unable to assess the
possible ripple on them of the effects of the collapse because of the
transitive nature of many investments (i.e., A owes B, B owes C, and C
owes D).

The adoption of a global \href{https://www.lei-worldwide.com}{legal
entity identifier} (LEI), should improve financial system regulation and
corporate risk management. Regulators will find it easier to monitor and
analyze threats to financial stability and risk managers will be more
able evaluate their companies' risks.
\end{quote}

The tables in a relational database are \textbf{connected} or
\textbf{related} by means of the data in the tables. You will learn, in
the next chapter, that this connection is through a pair of values---a
primary key and a foreign key. Consider a table of airlines serving a
city. When examining this table, you may not recognize the code of an
airline, so you then go to another table to find the name of the
airline. For example, if you inspect the next table, you find that AM is
an international airline serving Atlanta.

\emph{International airlines serving Atlanta}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}l@{}}
\toprule()
Airline \\
\midrule()
\endhead
AM \\
JL \\
KX \\
LM \\
MA \\
OS \\
RG \\
SN \\
SR \\
LH \\
LY \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

If you don't know which airline has the abbreviation AM, then you need
to look at the table of airline codes to discover that AeroMexico, with
code AM, serves Atlanta. The two tables are related by airline code.
Later, you will discover which is the primary key and which is the
foreign key.

\emph{A partial list of airline codes}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule()
Code & Airline \\
\midrule()
\endhead
AA & American Airlines \\
AC & Air Canada \\
AD & Lone Star Airlines \\
AE & Mandarin Airlines \\
AF & Air France \\
AG & Interprovincial Airlines \\
AI & Air India \\
AM & AeroMexico \\
AQ & Aloha Airlines \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

When designing the relational model, Codd provided commands for
processing multiple records at a time. His intention was to increase the
productivity of programmers by moving beyond the record-at-a-time
processing that is found in most programming languages. Consequently,
the relational model supports set processing (multiple
records-at-a-time), which is most frequently implemented as
\textbf{Structured Query Language (SQL).}\footnote{Officially pronounced
  as ``S-Q-L,'' but often also pronounced as ``sequel''.}

The relational model separates the logical design of a database from its
physical storage. This notion of \textbf{data independence} simplifies
data modeling and database programming. In this section, we focus on
logical database design, and now that you have had a brief introduction
to the relational model, you are ready to learn data modeling.

\hypertarget{getting-started}{%
\subsection{Getting started}\label{getting-started}}

As with most construction projects, building a relational database must
be preceded by a design phase. Data modeling, our design technique, is a
method for creating a plan or blueprint of a database. The data model
must accurately mirror real-world relationships if it is to support
processing business transactions and managerial decision making.

Rather than getting bogged down with a \emph{theory first, application
later} approach to database design and use, we will start with
application. We will get back to theory when you have some experience in
data modeling and database querying. After all, you did not learn to
talk by first studying sentence formation; you just started by learning
and using simple words. We start with the simplest data model, a single
entity, and the simplest database, a single table, as follows.

\hypertarget{modeling-a-single-entity-database}{%
\subsection{Modeling a single-entity
database}\label{modeling-a-single-entity-database}}

The simplest database contains information about one entity, which is
some real-world thing. Some entities are physical---CUSTOMER, ORDER, and
STUDENT; others are abstract or conceptual---WORK ASSIGNMENT, and
AUTHORSHIP. We represent an entity by a rectangle: the following figure
shows a representation of the entity SHARE. The name of the entity is
shown in singular form in uppercase in the top part of the rectangle.

\emph{The entity SHARE}

\includegraphics[width=1.58333in,height=\textheight]{Figures/Chapter 3/share.png}

An entity has characteristics or attributes. An \textbf{attribute} is a
discrete element of data; it is not usually broken down into smaller
components. Attributes are describe the data we want to store. Some
attributes of the entity SHARE are \emph{share code}, \emph{share name},
\emph{share price}, \emph{share quantity} (number owned), \emph{share
dividend}, and \emph{PE ratio} (price-to-earnings ratio).\footnote{Attributes
  are shown in italics.} Attributes are shown below the entity's name.
Notice that we refer to \emph{share price}, rather than \emph{price}, to
avoid confusion if there should be another entity with an attribute
called \emph{price}. Attribute names must be carefully selected so that
they are self-explanatory and unique. For example, \emph{share dividend}
is easily recognized as belonging to the entity SHARE.

\emph{The entity SHARE and its attributes}

\includegraphics[width=1.58333in,height=\textheight]{Figures/Chapter 3/share with attributes.png}

An \textbf{instance} is a particular occurrence of an entity (e.g.,
facts about Freedonia Copper). To avoid confusion, each instance of an
entity needs to be uniquely identified. Consider the case of customer
billing. In most cases, a request to bill Smith \$100 cannot be
accurately processed because a firm might have more than one Smith in
its customer file. If a firm has carefully controlled procedures for
ensuring that each customer has a unique means of identification, then a
request to bill customer number 1789 \$100 can be accurately processed.
An attribute or collection of attributes that uniquely identifies an
instance of an entity is called an \textbf{identifier}. The identifier
for the entity SHARE is \emph{share code}, a unique identifier assigned
by the stock exchange to a firm issuing shares.

There may be several attributes, or combinations of attributes, that are
feasible identifiers for an instance of an entity. Attributes that are
identifiers are prefixed by an asterisk. The following figure shows an
example of a representation of an entity, its attributes, and
identifier.

\emph{The entity SHARE, its attributes, and identifier}

\includegraphics[width=1.58333in,height=\textheight]{Figures/Chapter 3/share with identifier.png}

Briefly, entities are things in the environment about which we wish to
store information. Attributes describe an entity. An entity must have a
unique identifier.

In this book, MySQL is the relational database for teaching SQL. Because
SQL is a standard, it does not matter which implementation of the
relational model you use as the SQL language is common across both the

SQL statements can be written in any mix of valid upper and lowercase
characters. To make it easier for you to learn the syntax, this book
adopts the following conventions:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  SQL keywords are in uppercase.
\item
  Table and column names are in lowercase.
\end{itemize}

There are more elaborate layout styles, but we will bypass those because
it is more important at this stage to learn SQL. You should lay out your
SQL statements so that they are easily read by you and others.

The following table shows some of the data types supported by most
relational databases. Other implementations of the relational model may
support some of these data types and additional ones. It is a good idea
to review the available data types in your RDBMS before defining your
first table.

\emph{Some allowable data types}

\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

The CHAR and VARCHAR data types are similar but differ in the way
character strings are stored and retrieved. Both can be up to 255
characters long. The length of a CHAR column is fixed to the declared
length. When values are stored, they are right-padded with spaces to the
specified length. When CHAR values are retrieved, trailing spaces are
removed. VARCHAR columns store variable-length strings and use only as
many characters as are needed to store the string. Values are not
padded; instead, trailing spaces are removed. In this book, we use
VARCHAR to define most character strings, unless they are short (less
than five characters is a good rule-of-thumb).

The data for the \texttt{share} table will be used in subsequent
examples. If you have ready access to a relational database, it is a
good idea to now create a table and enter the data. Then you will be
able to use these data to practice querying the table.

\hypertarget{querying-a-single-table-database}{%
\subsection{Querying a single-table
database}\label{querying-a-single-table-database}}

The objective of developing a database is to make it easier to use the
stored data to solve problems. Typically, a manager raises a question
(e.g., How many shares have a PE ratio greater than 12?). A question or
request for information, usually called a query, is then translated into
a specific data manipulation or query language. The most widely used
query language for relational databases is SQL. After the query has been
executed, the resulting data are displayed. In the case of a relational
database, the answer to a query is always a table.

There is also a query language called \textbf{relational algebra}, which
describes a set of operations on tables. Sometimes it is useful to think
of queries in terms of these operations. Where appropriate, we will
introduce the corresponding relational algebra operation.

Generally we use a four-phase format for describing queries:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  A brief explanation of the query's purpose
\item
  The query in italics, prefixed by •, and some phrasing you might
  expect from a manager
\item
  The SQL version of the query
\item
  The results of the query.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{displaying-an-entire-table}{%

All the data in a table can be displayed using the SELECT statement. In
SQL, the \emph{all} part is indicated by an asterisk (*).

\hypertarget{projectchoosing-columns}{%
\subsubsection{Project---choosing
columns}\label{projectchoosing-columns}}

The relational algebra operation \textbf{project} creates a new table
from the columns of an existing table. Project takes a vertical slice
through a table by selecting all the values in specified columns. The
projection of \texttt{share} on columns \texttt{shrfirm} and
\texttt{shrpe} produces a new table with 10 rows and 2 columns. The SQL
syntax for the project operation simply lists the columns to be
displayed.

\hypertarget{restrictchoosing-rows}{%
\subsubsection{Restrict---choosing rows}\label{restrictchoosing-rows}}

The relational algebra operation \textbf{restrict} creates a new table
from the rows of an existing table. The operation restricts the new
table to those rows that satisfy a specified condition. Restrict takes
all columns of an existing table but only those rows that meet the
specified condition. The restriction of \texttt{share} to those rows
where the PE ratio is less than 12 will give a new table with five rows
and six columns.

Restrict is implemented in SQL using the WHERE clause to specify the
condition on which rows are restricted.

\emph{Get all firms with a price-earnings ratio less than 12.}

In this example, we have a less than condition for the WHERE clause. All
permissible comparison operators are listed below.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}

In addition to the comparison operators, the BETWEEN construct is
available.

The expression \texttt{a\ BETWEEN\ x\ AND\ y} is equivalent to
\texttt{a\ \textgreater{}=\ x\ AND\ a\ \textless{}=\ y}.

The purpose the primary key is to guarantee that any row in a table can
be uniquely addressed. In this example, we use \texttt{shrcode} to
return a single row because \texttt{shrcode} is unique for each instance
of \texttt{share}. The sought code (AR) must be specified in quotes
because \texttt{shrcode} was defined as a character string when the
table was created.

\hypertarget{numeric-versus-character-sorting}{%
\subsubsection{Numeric versus character
sorting}\label{numeric-versus-character-sorting}}

Numeric data in character fields (e.g., a product code) do not always
sort the way you initially expect. The difference arises from the way
data are stored:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Numeric fields are right justified and have leading zeros.
\item
  Character fields are left justified and have trailing spaces.
\end{itemize}

For example, the value 1066 stored as CHAR(4) would be stored as `1066'
and the value 45 would be stored as `45'. If the column containing these
data is sorted in ascending order, then `1066' precedes `45' because the
leftmost character `1' is less than `4'. You can avoid this problem by
always storing numeric values as numeric data types (e.g., integer or
decimal) or preceding numeric values with zeros when they are stored as
character data. Alternatively, start numbering at 1,000 so that all
values are four digits, though the best solution is to store numeric
data as numbers rather than characters.

\hypertarget{derived-data}{%
\subsubsection{Derived data}\label{derived-data}}

One of the important principles of database design is to avoid
redundancy. One form of redundancy is including a column in a table when
these data can be derived from other columns. For example, we do not
need a column for yield because it can be calculated by dividing
dividend by price and multiplying by 100 to obtain the yield as a
percentage. This means that the query language does the calculation when
the value is required.

\emph{Get firm name, price, quantity, and firm yield.}

You can give the results of the calculation a column name. In this case,
a good choice is \texttt{yield}. Note the use of AS to indicate the name
of the column in which the results of the calculation are displayed.

In the preceding query, the keyword AS is introduced to specify an
alias, or temporary name. The statement specifies that the result of the
calculation is to be reported under the column heading \texttt{yield}.
You can rename any column or specify a name for the results of an
expression using an alias.

\hypertarget{aggregate-functions}{%
\subsubsection{Aggregate functions}\label{aggregate-functions}}

SQL has built-in functions to enhance its retrieval power and handle
many common aggregation queries, such as computing the total value of a
column. Four of these functions (AVG, SUM, MIN, and MAX) work very
similarly. COUNT is a little different.

\hypertarget{count}{%
\paragraph{COUNT}\label{count}}

COUNT computes the number of rows in a table. Use COUNT(*) to count all
rows irrespective of their content (i.e., null or not null), and use
COUNT(\texttt{columnname}) to count rows without a null value for
\texttt{columname}. Count can be used with a WHERE clause to specify a
condition.

\hypertarget{sum-min-and-max}{%
\paragraph{SUM, MIN, and MAX}\label{sum-min-and-max}}

SUM, MIN, and MAX differ in the statistic they calculate but are used
similarly to AVG. As with AVG, null values in a column are not included
in the calculation. SUM computes the sum of a column of values. MIN
finds the smallest value in a column; MAX finds the largest.

\hypertarget{subqueries}{%
\subsubsection{Subqueries}\label{subqueries}}

Sometimes we need the answer to another query before we can write the
query of ultimate interest. For example, to list all shares with a PE
ratio greater than the portfolio average, you first must find the
average PE ratio for the portfolio. You could do the query in two
stages:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \FunctionTok{AVG}\NormalTok{(shrpe) }\KeywordTok{FROM} \KeywordTok{share}\NormalTok{;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

and

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT}\NormalTok{ shrfirm, shrpe }\KeywordTok{FROM} \KeywordTok{share} \KeywordTok{WHERE}\NormalTok{ shrpe }\OperatorTok{\textgreater{}}\NormalTok{ x;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

where x is the value returned from the first query.

Unfortunately, the two-stage method introduces the possibility of
errors. You might forget the value returned by the first query or enter
it incorrectly. It also takes longer to get the results of the query. We
can solve these problems by using parentheses to indicate the first
query is nested within the second one. As a result, the value returned
by the inner or nested subquery, the one in parentheses, is used in the
outer query. In the following example, the nested query returns 11.20,
which is then automatically substituted in the outer query.

\emph{Report all firms with a PE ratio greater than the average for the

this case, because the alias includes a space, the entire alias is
enclosed in straight quotes.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Quotes}

There are three types of quotes that you can typically use with SQL.
Double and single quotes are equivalent and can be used interchangeably.

In SQL, queries are written using the SELECT statement. Project
(choosing columns) and restrict (choosing rows) are common table
operations. The WHERE clause is used to specify row selection criteria.
WHERE can be combined with IN and NOT IN, which specify values for a
single column. The rows of a report are sorted using the ORDER BY
clause. Arithmetic expressions can appear in SQL statements, and SQL has
built-in functions for common arithmetic operations. A subquery is a
query within a query. Regular expressions are used to find string
patterns within character strings. Duplicate rows are eliminated with
the DISTINCT clause.

\hypertarget{relationships}{%
\subsection{Relationships}\label{relationships}}

Entities are not isolated; they are related to other entities. When we
move beyond the single entity, we need to identify the relationships
between entities to accurately represent the real world. Consider the
case where a person's stocks are listed in different countries. We now
need to introduce an entity called NATION. We now have two entities,
STOCK and NATION. Consider the relationship between them. A NATION can
have many listed stocks. A stock, in this case, is listed in only one
nation. There is a 1:m (one-to-many) relationship between NATION and
STOCK.

A 1:m relationship between two entities is depicted by a line connecting
the two with a crow's foot at the many end of the relationship. The
following figure shows the 1:m relationship between NATION and STOCK.
This can be read as: ``a nation can have many stocks, but a stock
belongs to only one nation.'' The entity NATION is identified by
\emph{nation code} and has attributes \emph{nation name} and
\emph{exchange rate}.

\emph{A 1:m relationship between NATION and STOCK}

\includegraphics[width=3.91667in,height=\textheight]{Figures/Chapter 4/nation-stock.png}

The 1:m relationship occurs frequently in business situations. Sometimes
it occurs in a tree or hierarchical fashion. Consider a very
hierarchical firm. It has many divisions, but a division belongs to only
one firm. A division has many departments, but a department belongs to
only one division. A department has many sections, but a section belongs
to only one department.

Another approach to adding data about listing nation and exchange rate
is to add two attributes to STOCK: \emph{nation name} and \emph{exchange
rate}. At first glance, this seems a very workable solution; however,
this will introduce considerable redundancy, as the following table
illustrates.

The exact same nation name and exchange rate pair occurs 10 times for
stocks listed in the United Kingdom. This redundancy presents problems
when we want to insert, delete, or update data. These problems,
generally known as \textbf{update anomalies}, occur with these three
basic operations.

\hypertarget{insert-anomalies}{%
\paragraph{Insert anomalies}\label{insert-anomalies}}

We cannot insert a fact about a nation's exchange rate unless we first
buy a stock that is listed in that nation. Consider the case where we
want to keep a record of France's exchange rate and we have no French
stocks. We cannot skirt this problem by putting in a null entry for
stock details because stkcode, the primary key, would be null, and this
is not allowed. If we have a separate table for facts about a nation,
then we can easily add new nations without having to buy stocks. This is
particularly useful when other parts of the organization, say
International Trading, also need access to exchange rates for many
nations.

\hypertarget{delete-anomalies}{%
\paragraph{Delete anomalies}\label{delete-anomalies}}

If we delete data about a particular stock, we might also lose a fact
about exchange rates. For example, if we delete details of Bombay Duck,
we also erase the Indian exchange rate.

\hypertarget{update-anomalies}{%
\paragraph{Update anomalies}\label{update-anomalies}}

Exchange rates are volatile. Most companies need to update them every
day. What happens when the Australian exchange rate changes? Every row
in stock with nation = `Australia' will have to be updated. In a large
portfolio, many rows will be changed. There is also the danger of
someone forgetting to update all the instances of the nation and
exchange rate pair. As a result, there could be two exchange rates for
the one nation. If exchange rate is stored in a nation table, however,
only one change is necessary, there is no redundancy, and there is no
danger of inconsistent exchange rates.

The 1:m relationship is mapped by adding a column to the entity at the
many end of the relationship. The additional column contains the
identifier of the one end of the relationship.

Consider the relationship between the entities STOCK and NATION. The
database has two tables: \texttt{stock} and \texttt{nation.} The table
stock has an additional column, natcode, which contains the primary key
of nation. If natcode is not stored in \texttt{stock}, then there is no
way of knowing the identity of the nation where the \texttt{stock} is
listed.

Notice that \texttt{natcode} appears in both the \texttt{stock} and
\texttt{nation} tables. In \texttt{nation}, \texttt{natcode} is the
primary key; it is unique for each instance of \texttt{nation.} In table
\texttt{stock}, \texttt{natcode} is a \textbf{foreign key} because it is
the primary key of \texttt{nation}, the one end of the 1:m relationship.
The column \texttt{natcode} is a foreign key in \texttt{stock} because
it is a primary key in \texttt{nation}. A matched primary key--foreign
key pair is the method for recording the 1:m relationship between the
two tables. This method of representing a relationship is illustrated
using shading and arrows for the two USA stocks. In the \texttt{stock}
table, \texttt{natcode} is italicized to indicate that it is a foreign
key. This method, like asterisking a primary key, is a useful reminder.

Although the same name has been used for the primary key and the foreign
key in this example, it is not mandatory. The two columns can have
different names, and in some cases you are forced to use different
names. When possible, we find it convenient to use identical column
names to help us remember that the tables are related. To distinguish
between columns with identical names, they must by \textbf{qualified} by
prefixing the table name. In this case, use \texttt{nation.natcode} and
\texttt{stock.natcode.} Thus, \texttt{nation.natcode} refers to the
\texttt{natcode} column in the table \texttt{nation.}

Although a nation can have many stocks, it is not mandatory to have any.
That is, in data modeling terminology, many can be zero, one, or more,
but it is mandatory to have a value for \texttt{natcode} in
\texttt{nation} for every value of \texttt{natcode} in \texttt{stock}.
This requirement, known as the \textbf{referential integrity
constraint}, helps maintain the accuracy of a database. Its application
means that every foreign key in a table has an identical primary key in
that same table or another table. In this example, it means that for
every value of \texttt{natcode} in \texttt{stock}, there is a
corresponding entry in \texttt{nation}. As a result, a primary key row
must be created before its corresponding foreign key row. In other
words, details for a \texttt{nation} must be added before any data about
its listed stocks are entered.

Every foreign key must have a matching primary key (referential
integrity rule), and every primary key must be non-null (entity
integrity rule). A foreign key cannot be null when a relationship is
mandatory, as in the case where a stock must belong to a nation. If a
relationship is optional (a person can have a boss), then a foreign key
can be null (i.e., a person is the head of the organization, and thus
has no boss). The ideas of mandatory and optional will be discussed
later in this book.

Why is the foreign key in the table at the ``many'' end of the
relationship? Because each instance of \texttt{stock} is associated with
exactly one instance of \texttt{nation}. The rule is that a
\texttt{stock} must be listed in one, and only one, nation. Thus, the
foreign key field is single-valued when it is at the ``many'' end of a
relationship. The foreign key is not at the ``one'' end of the
relationship because each instance of nation can be associated with more
than one instance of \texttt{stock}, and this implies a multivalued
foreign key. The relational model does not support multivalued fields.

\hypertarget{mysql-workbench}{%
\subsubsection{MySQL Workbench}\label{mysql-workbench}}

In Workbench, a 1:m relationship is represented in a similar manner to
the method you have just learned. Also, note that the foreign key is
shown in the entity at the many end with a red diamond. We omit the
foreign key when data modeling because it can be inferred.

\subsection{Querying a two-table
database}\label{querying-a-two-table-database}}

A two-table database offers the opportunity to learn more SQL and
another relational algebra operation: join.

\hypertarget{join}{%
\subsubsection{Join}\label{join}}

Join creates a new table from two existing tables by matching on a
column common to both tables. Usually, the common column is a primary
key--foreign key pair: The primary key of one table is matched with the
foreign key of another table. Join is frequently used to get the data
for a query into a single row. Consider the tables \texttt{nation} and
\texttt{stock}. If we want to calculate the value---in British
pounds---of a stock, we multiply stock price by stock quantity and then
exchange rate. To find the appropriate exchange rate for a stock, get
its \texttt{natcode} from stock and then find the exchange rate in the
matching row in \texttt{nation}, the one with the same value for
\texttt{natcode}. For example, to calculate the value of Georgia Peach,
which has \texttt{natcode} = `US', find the row in \texttt{nation} that
also has \texttt{natcode} = `US'. In this case, the stock's value is
2.35 * 387333 / 0.67 = £609,855.81.

Calculation of stock value is very easy once a join is used to get the
three values in one row. The SQL command for joining the two tables is:

\emph{The join of stock and nation}

The columns \texttt{stkprice} and \texttt{stkdiv} record values in the
country's currency. Thus, the price of Bombay Duck is 25.55 Indian
rupees. To find the value in U.K. pounds (GPB), multiply the price by
0.0228, because one rupee is worth 0.0228 GPB. The value of one share of
Bombay Duck in U.S. dollars (USD) is 25.55 * 0.0228 / 0.67 because one
USD is worth 0.67 GBP.

There are several things to notice about the SQL command and the result:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  To avoid confusion because \texttt{natcode} is a column name in both
  stock and nation, it needs to be qualified. If \texttt{natcode} is not
  qualified, the system will reject the query because it cannot
  distinguish between the two columns titled \texttt{natcode}.
\item
  The new table has the \texttt{natcode} column replicated. Both are
  called \texttt{natcode}. The naming convention for the replicated
  column varies with the RDBMS. The columns, for example, should be
  labeled \texttt{stock.natcode} and \texttt{nation.natcode}.
\item
  The SQL command specifies the names of the tables to be joined, the
  columns to be used for matching, and the condition for the match
  (equality in this case).
\item
  The number of columns in the new table is the sum of the columns in
  the two tables.
\item
  The stock value calculation is now easily specified in an SQL command
  because all the data are in one row.
\end{itemize}

Remember that during data modeling we created two entities, STOCK and
NATION, and defined the relationship between them. We showed that if the
data were stored in one table, there could be updating problems. Now,
with a join, we have combined these data. So why separate the data only
to put them back together later? There are two reasons. First, we want
to avoid update anomalies. Second, as you will discover, we do not join
the same tables every time.

A join can be combined with other SQL commands.

In this example, stocks are grouped by both \texttt{natname} and
\texttt{stkpe}. In most cases, there is only one stock for each pair of
\texttt{natname} and \texttt{stkpe}; however, there are two situations
(U.K. stocks with PEs of 10 and 16) where details of multiple stocks are

\hypertarget{subqueries-1}{%
\subsection{Subqueries}\label{subqueries-1}}

A subquery, or nested SELECT, is a SELECT nested within another SELECT.
A subquery can be used to return a list of values subsequently searched
with an IN clause.

\emph{Report the names of all Australian stocks.}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT}\NormalTok{ stkfirm }\KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ stock}
    \KeywordTok{WHERE}\NormalTok{ natcode }\KeywordTok{IN}
\NormalTok{        (}\KeywordTok{SELECT}\NormalTok{ natcode }\KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ nation}
            \KeywordTok{WHERE}\NormalTok{ natname }\OperatorTok{=} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Australia\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}l@{}}

\midrule()
\endfirsthead
\toprule()
stkfirm \\
\midrule()
\endhead
Indooroopilly Ruby \\
Narembeen Emu \\
Queensland Diamond \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

Conceptually, the subquery is evaluated first. It returns a list of
values for natcode (`AUS') so that the query then is the same as:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT}\NormalTok{ stkfirm }\KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ stock}
    \KeywordTok{WHERE}\NormalTok{ natcode }\KeywordTok{IN}\NormalTok{ (}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}AUS\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

When discussing subqueries, sometimes a subquery is also called an
\textbf{inner query}. The term \textbf{outer query} is applied to the
SQL preceding the inner query. In this case, the outer and inner queries
are:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 2\tabcolsep) * \real{0.2105}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 2\tabcolsep) * \real{0.7895}}@{}}
\toprule()
\endhead
Outer query & SELECT stkfirm FROM stock WHERE natcode IN \\
Inner query & (SELECT natcode FROM nation WHERE natname =
`Australia'); \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

Note that in this case we do not have to qualify \texttt{natcode}. There
is no identity crisis, because \texttt{natcode} in the inner query is
implicitly qualified as \texttt{nation.natcode} and \texttt{natcode} in
the outer query is understood to be \texttt{stock.natcode}.

This query also can be run as a join by writing:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT}\NormalTok{ stkfirm }\KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ stock }\KeywordTok{JOIN}\NormalTok{ nation}
    \KeywordTok{ON}\NormalTok{ stock.natcode }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ nation.natcode}
    \KeywordTok{AND}\NormalTok{ natname }\OperatorTok{=} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Australia\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{correlated-subquery}{%
\subsubsection{Correlated subquery}\label{correlated-subquery}}

In a correlated subquery, the subquery cannot be evaluated independently
of the outer query. It depends on the outer query for the values it
needs to resolve the inner query. The subquery is evaluated for each
value passed to it by the outer query. An example illustrates when you
might use a correlated subquery and how it operates.

\emph{Find those stocks where the quantity is greater than the average
for that country.}

An approach to this query is to examine the rows of stock one a time,
and each time compare the quantity of stock to the average for that
country. This means that for each row, the subquery must receive the
outer query's country code so it can compute the average for that
country.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT}\NormalTok{ natname, stkfirm, stkqty }\KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ stock }\KeywordTok{JOIN}\NormalTok{ nation}
    \KeywordTok{ON}\NormalTok{ stock.natcode }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ nation.natcode}
    \KeywordTok{WHERE}\NormalTok{ stkqty }\OperatorTok{\textgreater{}}
\NormalTok{        (}\KeywordTok{SELECT} \FunctionTok{avg}\NormalTok{(stkqty) }\KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ stock}
            \KeywordTok{WHERE}\NormalTok{ stock.natcode }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ nation.natcode);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llr@{}}
\caption{4 records}\tabularnewline
\toprule()
natname & stkfirm & stkqty \\
\midrule()
\endfirsthead
\toprule()
natname & stkfirm & stkqty \\

\endhead
Australia & Queensland Diamond & 89251 \\
United Kingdom & Bolivian Sheep & 231678 \\
United Kingdom & Royal Ostrich Farms & 1234923 \\
United States & Minnesota Gold & 816122 \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

Conceptually, think of this query as stepping through the join of
\texttt{stock} and \texttt{nation} one row at a time and executing the
subquery each time. The first row has \texttt{natcode} = `AUS' so the
subquery becomes

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \FunctionTok{AVG}\NormalTok{(stkqty) }\KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ stock}
    \KeywordTok{WHERE}\NormalTok{ stock.natcode }\OperatorTok{=} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}AUS\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Since the average stock quantity for Australian stocks is 63,672.33, the
first row in the join, Narembeen Emu, is not reported. Neither is the
second row reported, but the third is.

The term \textbf{correlated subquery} is used because the inner query's
execution depends on receiving a value for a variable
(\texttt{nation.natcode} in this instance) from the outer query. Thus,
the inner query of the correlated subquery cannot be evaluated once and
for all. It must be evaluated repeatedly---once for each value of the
variable received from the outer query. In this respect, a correlated
subquery is different from a subquery, where the inner query needs to be
evaluated only once. The requirement to compare each row of a table
against a function (e.g., average or count) for some rows of a column is
usually a clue that you need to write a correlated subquery.

\begin{quote}
❓ \emph{Skill builder}

Why are no Indian stocks reported in the correlated subquery example?
How would you change the query to report an Indian stock? Report only
the three stocks with the largest quantities (i.e., do the query without
using ORDER BY).

\hypertarget{summary-1}{%
\subsection*{Summary}\label{summary-1}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Summary}

Entities are related to other entities by relationships. The 1:m
(one-to-many) relationship occurs frequently in data models. An
additional entity is required to represent a 1:m relationship to avoid
update anomalies. In a relational database, a 1:m relationship is
represented by an additional column, the foreign key, in the table at
the many end of the relationship. The referential integrity constraint
insists that a foreign key must always exist as a primary key in a
table. A foreign key constraint is specified in a CREATE statement.

Join creates a new table from two existing tables by matching on a
column common to both tables. Often the common column is a primary
key--foreign key combination. The GROUP BY clause is used to create an
elementary control break report. The HAVING clause of GROUP BY is like
the WHERE clause of SELECT. A subquery, which has a SELECT statement
within another SELECT statement, causes two SELECT statements to be
executed---one for the inner query and one for the outer query.

\hypertarget{the-many-to-many-relationship-1}{%
\subsection{The many-to-many
relationship}\label{the-many-to-many-relationship-1}}

Consider the case when items are sold. We can immediately identify two
entities: SALE and ITEM. A sale can contain many items, and an item can
appear in many sales. We are not saying the same item can be sold many
times, but the particular type of item (e.g., a compass) can be sold
many times; thus we have a many-to-many (m:m) relationship between SALE
and ITEM. When we have an m:m relationship, we create a third entity to
link the entities through two 1:m relationships. Usually, it is fairly
easy to name this third entity. In this case, this third entity,
typically known as an \textbf{associative entity}, is called LINE ITEM.
A typical old style sales form lists the items purchased by a customer.
Each of the lines appearing on the order form is generally known in
retailing as a line item, which links an item and a sale.

\emph{A sales form} \includegraphics{Figures/Chapter 5/sales form.png}

The representation of this m:m relationship is shown. We say
many-to-many because there are two relationships---an ITEM is related to
many SALEs, and a SALE is related to many ITEMs. This data model can
also be read as: ``a sale has many line items, but a line item refers to
only one sale. Similarly, an item can appear as many line items, but a
line item references only one item.''

\emph{An m:m relationship between SALE and ITEM}

\includegraphics[width=5.89583in,height=\textheight]{Figures/Chapter 5/sale-item.png}

The entity SALE is identified by \emph{saleno} and has the attributes
\emph{saledate} and \emph{saletext} (a brief comment on the
customer---soft information). LINEITEM is partially identified by
\emph{lineno} and has attributes \emph{lineqty} (the number of units
sold) and \emph{lineprice} (the unit selling price for this sale). ITEM
is identified by \emph{itemno} and has attributes \emph{itemname},
\emph{itemtype} (e.g., clothing, equipment, navigation aids, furniture,
and so on), and \emph{itemcolor}.

If you look carefully at the m:m relationship figure, you will notice
that there is a plus sign (+) above the crow's foot at the ``many'' end
of the 1:m relationship between SALE and LINEITEM. This plus sign
provides information about the identifier of LINEITEM. As you know,
every entity must have a unique identifier. A sales order is a series of
rows or lines, and \emph{lineno} is unique only within a particular
order. If we just use \emph{lineno} as the identifier, we cannot
guarantee that every instance of LINEITEM is unique. If we use
\emph{saleno} and \emph{lineno} together, however, we have a unique
identifier for every instance of LINEITEM. Identifier \emph{saleno} is
unique for every sale, and \emph{lineno} is unique within any sale. The
plus indicates that LINEITEM's unique identifier is the concatenation of
\emph{saleno} and \emph{lineno}. The order of concatenation does not
matter.

LINEITEM is termed a \textbf{weak entity} because it relies on another
entity for its existence and identification.

\hypertarget{mysql-workbench-1}{%
\subsubsection{MySQL Workbench}\label{mysql-workbench-1}}

\emph{An m:m relationship with Workbench}

\includegraphics{Figures/Chapter 5/m-m-wb.png}

Workbench distinguishes between two types of relationships. An
\textbf{identifying relationship}, shown by a solid line, is used when
the entity at the many end of the relationship is a weak entity and
needs the identifier of the one end of the relationship to uniquely
identify an instance of the relationship, as in LINEITEM. An identifying
relationship corresponds to the + sign associated with a crow's foot.
The other type of relationship, shown by a dashed line, is known as a
\emph{non-identifying} relationship. The mapping between the type of
relationship and the representation (i.e., dashed or solid line) is
arbitrary and thus not always easily recalled. We think that using a +
on the crow's foot is a better way of denoting weak entities.

When the relationship between SALE and ITEM is drawn in Workbench, as
shown in the following figure, there are two things to notice.
\emph{First}, the table, lineitem, maps the associative entity generated
for the m:m relationship. \emph{Second}, lineitem has an identifying
relationship with sale and a non-identifying relationship with item.

\emph{An m:m relationship between SALE and ITEM in MySQL Workbench}

\hypertarget{why-did-we-create-a-third-entity}{%
\subsubsection{Why did we create a third
entity?}\label{why-did-we-create-a-third-entity}}

When we have an m:m relationship, we create an associative entity to
store data about the relationship. In this case, we have to store data
about the items sold. We cannot store the data with SALE because a sale
can have many items, and an instance of an entity stores only
single-value facts. Similarly, we cannot store data with ITEM because an
item can appear in many sales. Since we cannot store data in SALE or
ITEM, we must create another entity to store data about the m:m
relationship.

You might find it useful to think of the m:m relationship as two 1:m
relationships. An item can appear on many line item listings, and a line
item entry refers to only one item. A sale has many line items, and each
line item entry refers to only one sale.

\textbf{\emph{Social Security number is notunique!}}

Two girls named Sarah Lee Ferguson were born on May 3, 1959. The U.S.
government considered them one and the same and issued both the same
Social Security number (SSN), a nine-digit identifier of U.S. residents.
Now Sarah Lee Ferguson Boles and Sarah Lee Ferguson Johnson share the
same SSN.\footnote{``Two women share a name, birthday, and S.S.
  number!'' Athens Daily News, January 29 1990, 7A. Also, see
  \url{https://www.computerworld.com/article/3004659/a-tale-of-two-women-same-birthday-same-social-security-number-same-big-data-mess.html}}

Mrs.~Boles became aware of her SSN twin in 1987 when the Internal
Revenue Service claimed there was a discrepancy in her reported income
Because SSN is used as an identifier in IRS systems. Mrs.~Boles
encountered other incidents of mistaken identity. Some of Mrs.~Johnson's
purchases appeared on Mrs.~Boles' credit reports.

In late 1989, the Social Security Administration notified Mrs.~Boles
that her original number was given to her in error and she had to
provide evidence of her age, identity, and citizenship to get a new
number. When Mrs.~Boles got her new SSN, it is likely she had to also
get a new driver's license and establish a new credit history.

\subsubsection{A three-table join}\label{a-three-table-join}}

The join operation can be easily extended from two tables to three or
more merely by specifying the tables to be joined and the matching
conditions. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \OperatorTok{*} \KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ sale }\KeywordTok{JOIN}\NormalTok{ lineitem}
    \KeywordTok{ON}\NormalTok{ sale.saleno }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ lineitem.saleno}

    \KeywordTok{ON}\NormalTok{ item.itemno }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ lineitem.itemno;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

There are two matching conditions: one for \texttt{sale} and
\texttt{lineitem} (\texttt{sale.saleno} = \texttt{lineitem.saleno}) and
one for the item and \texttt{lineitem} tables (\texttt{item.itemno} =
\texttt{lineitem.itemno}). The table \texttt{lineitem} is the link
between \texttt{sale} and \texttt{item} and must be referenced in both
matching conditions.

You can tailor the join to be more precise and report some columns
rather than all.

Because there is at least one row in \texttt{lineitem} with
\texttt{itemno} = 6, the subquery returns \emph{true}. The item has been
sold and should be reported. The second clothing item, Hat---Polar
Explorer (white), in \texttt{item} has \texttt{itemno} = 7. There are no
rows in \texttt{lineitem} with \texttt{itemno} = 7, so the subquery
returns \emph{false}. That item has not been sold and should not be
reported.

You can also think of the query as, ``Select clothing items for which a
sale exists.'' Remember, for EXISTS to return \emph{true}, there needs
to be only one row for which the condition is \emph{true}.

\hypertarget{not-existsselect-a-value-if-it-does-not-exist}{%
\subsubsection{NOT EXISTS---select a value if it does not

NOT EXISTS is the negative of EXISTS. It is used in a WHERE clause to
test whether all rows in a table fail to satisfy a specified condition.
It returns the value \emph{true} if there are no rows satisfying the
condition; otherwise it returns \emph{false}.

\emph{Report all clothing items that have not been sold.}

Set operators are useful for combining the values derived from two or
more SQL queries. The UNION operation is equivalent to \emph{or}.

\emph{List items that were sold on January 16, 2011, or are brown.}

Resolution of this query requires two tables: one to report items sold
on January 16, 2011, and one to report the brown items. UNION (i.e., or)
then combines the results of the tables, including \emph{any} rows in
both tables and excluding duplicate rows.

There can be a many-to-many (m:m) relationship between entities, which
is represented by creating an associative entity and two 1:m
relationships. An associative entity stores data about an m:m
relationship. The join operation can be extended from two tables to
three or more tables. EXISTS tests whether a table has at least one row
that meets a specified condition. NOT EXISTS tests whether all rows in a
table do not satisfy a specified condition. Both EXISTS and NOT EXISTS
can return \emph{true} or \emph{false}. The relational operation divide,
also known as \emph{forall}, can be translated into a double negative.
It is represented in SQL by a query containing two NOT EXISTS
statements. Set operations enable the results of queries to be combined.

\hypertarget{structured-query-language}{%
\subsection*{Structured query

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Structured query language}

\textbf{Structured query language} (SQL) is widely used as a relational
database language, and SQL skills are essential for data management in a
world that is increasingly reliant on database technology. SQL
originated in the IBM Research Laboratory in San Jose, California.
Versions have since been implemented by commercial database vendors and
open source teams for a wide range of operating systems. Both the
American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) have designated SQL as a standard
language for relational database systems.

SQL is a \textbf{complete database language}. It is used for defining a
relational database, creating views, and specifying queries. In
addition, it allows for rows to be inserted, updated, and deleted. In
database terminology, it is both a \textbf{data definition language}
(DDL), a \textbf{data manipulation language} (DML), and a \textbf{data
control language} (DCL). SQL, however, is not a complete programming
language like Python, R, and Java. Because SQL statements can be
embedded into general-purpose programming languages, SQL is often used
in conjunction with such languages to create application programs. The
\textbf{embedded SQL} statements handle the database processing, and the
statements in the general-purpose language perform the necessary tasks
to complete the application.

\hypertarget{data-types}{%
\subsection*{Data types}\label{data-types}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Data types}

Some of the variety of data types that can be used are depicted in the
following figure and described in more detail in the following pages.

\emph{Data types}

\includegraphics{Figures/Chapter 10/data types.png}

\hypertarget{boolean}{%
\subsubsection*{BOOLEAN}\label{boolean}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{BOOLEAN}

Boolean data types can have the values true, false, or unknown.

\hypertarget{smallint-and-integer}{%
\subsubsection*{SMALLINT and INTEGER}\label{smallint-and-integer}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{SMALLINT and INTEGER}

Most commercial computers have a 32-bit word, where a word is a unit of
storage. An integer can be stored in a full word or half a word. If it
is stored in a full word (INTEGER), then it can be 31 binary digits in
length. If half-word storage is used (SMALLINT), then it can be 15
binary digits long. In each case, one bit is used for the sign of the
number. A column defined as INTEGER can store a number in the range
-2\textsuperscript{31} to 2\textsuperscript{31}-1 or -2,147,483,648 to
2,147,483,647. A column defined as SMALLINT can store a number in the
range -2\textsuperscript{15} to 2\textsuperscript{15}-1 or -32,768 to
32,767. Just remember that INTEGER is good for ±2 billion and SMALLINT
for ±32,000.

\hypertarget{float}{%
\subsubsection*{FLOAT}\label{float}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{FLOAT}

Scientists often deal with numbers that are very large (e.g., Avogadro's
number is 6.02252×10\textsuperscript{23}) or very small (e.g., Planck's
constant is 6.6262×10\textsuperscript{-34} joule sec). The FLOAT data
type is used for storing such numbers, often referred to as
\emph{floating-point} numbers. A single-precision floating-point number
requires 32 bits and can represent numbers in the range
-7.2×10\textsuperscript{75} to -5.4×10\textsuperscript{-79}, 0,
5.4×10\textsuperscript{-79} to 7.2×10\textsuperscript{75} with a
precision of about 7 decimal digits. A double-precision floating-point
number requires 64 bits. The range is the same as for a single-precision
floating-point number. The extra 32 bits are used to increase precision
to about 15 decimal digits.

In the specification FLOAT(n), if \emph{n} is between 1 and 21
inclusive, single-precision floating-point is selected. If \emph{n} is
between 22 and 53 inclusive, the storage format is double-precision
floating-point. If \emph{n} is not specified, double-precision
floating-point is assumed.

\hypertarget{decimal}{%
\subsubsection*{DECIMAL}\label{decimal}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{DECIMAL}

Binary is the most convenient form of storing data from a computer's
perspective. People, however, work with a decimal number system. The
DECIMAL data type is convenient for business applications because data
storage requirements are defined in terms of the maximum number of
places to the left and right of the decimal point. To store the current
value of an ounce of gold, you would possibly use DECIMAL(6,2) because
this would permit a maximum value of \$9,999.99. Notice that the general
form is DECIMAL(p,q), where p is the total number of digits in the
column, and q is the number of digits to the right of the decimal point.

\hypertarget{char-and-varchar}{%
\subsubsection*{CHAR and VARCHAR}\label{char-and-varchar}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{CHAR and VARCHAR}

Nonnumeric columns are stored as character strings. A person's family
name is an example of a column that is stored as a character string.
CHAR(n) defines a column that has a fixed length of n characters, where
n can be a maximum of 255.

When a column's length can vary greatly, it makes sense to define the
field as VARCHAR. A column defined as VARCHAR consists of two parts: a
header indicating the length of the character string and the string. If
a table contains a column that occasionally stores a long string of text
(e.g., a message field), then defining it as VARCHAR makes sense.
VARCHAR can store strings up to 65,535 characters long.

Why not store all character columns as VARCHAR and save space? There is
a price for using VARCHAR with some relational systems. \emph{First},
additional space is required for the header to indicate the length of
the string. \emph{Second}, additional processing time is required to
handle a variable-length string compared to a fixed-length string.
Depending on the RDBMS and processor speed, these might be important
considerations, and some systems will automatically make an appropriate
choice. For example, if you use both data types in the same table, MySQL
will automatically change CHAR into VARCHAR for compatibility reasons.

There are some columns where there is no trade-off because all possible
entries are always the same length. Canadian postal codes, for instance,
are always six characters (e.g., the postal code for Ottawa is K1A0A1).

Data compression is another approach to the \emph{space wars} problem. A
database can be defined with generous allowances for fixed-length
character columns so that few values are truncated. Data compression can
be used to compress the file to remove \emph{wasted} space. Data
compression, however, is slow and will increase the time to process
queries. You save space at the cost of time, and save time at the cost
of space. When dealing with character fields, the database designer has
to decide whether time or space is more important.

\hypertarget{times-and-dates}{%
\subsubsection*{Times and dates}\label{times-and-dates}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Times and dates}

Columns that have a data type of DATE are stored as \emph{yyyymmdd}
(e.g., 2022-11-04 for November 4, 2022). There are two reasons for this
format. \emph{First,} it is convenient for sorting in chronological
order. The common American way of writing dates (\emph{mmddyy}) requires
processing before chronological sorting. \emph{Second}, the full form of
the year should be recorded for exactness.

For similar reasons, it makes sense to store times in the form
\emph{hhmmss} with the understanding that this is 24-hour time (also
known as European time and military time). This is the format used for
data type TIME.

Some applications require precise recording of events. For example,
transaction processing systems typically record the time a transaction
was processed by the system. Because computers operate at high speed,
the TIMESTAMP data type records date and time with microsecond accuracy.
A timestamp has seven parts: year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and
microsecond. Date and time are defined as previously described (i.e.,
\emph{yyyymmdd} and \emph{hhmmss}, respectively). The range of the
microsecond part is 000000 to 999999.

Although times and dates are stored in a particular format, the
formatting facilities that generally come with a RDBMS usually allow
tailoring of time and date output to suit local standards. Thus for a
U.S. firm, date might appear on a report in the form \emph{mm/dd/yy};
for a European firm following the ISO standard, date would appear as
\emph{yyyy-mm-dd}.

SQL-99 introduced the INTERVAL data type, which is a single value
expressed in some unit or units of time (e.g., 6 years, 5 days, 7
hours).

BLOB is a large-object data type that stores any kind of binary data.

available. You will need to consult the documentation for your version
of SQL to determine the functions it supports. For example, Microsoft
SQL Server has more than 100 additional functions.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

A vendor's additional functions can be very useful. Remember, though,
that use of a vendor's extensions might limit portability.

\hypertarget{formatting}{%
\subsection*{Formatting}\label{formatting}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Formatting}

You will likely have noticed that some queries report numeric values
with a varying number of decimal places. The FORMAT function gives you
control over the number of decimal places reported, as illustrated in
the following example where yield is reported with two decimal places.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT}\NormalTok{ shrfirm, shrprice, shrqty, FORMAT(shrdiv}\OperatorTok{/}\NormalTok{shrprice}\OperatorTok{*}\DecValTok{100}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)}
  \KeywordTok{AS}\NormalTok{ yield}
    \KeywordTok{FROM} \KeywordTok{share}\NormalTok{;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

When you use format you create a string, but you often want to sort on
the numeric value of the formatted field. The following example
illustrates how to do this.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT}\NormalTok{ shrfirm, shrprice, shrqty, FORMAT(shrdiv}\OperatorTok{/}\NormalTok{shrprice}\OperatorTok{*}\DecValTok{100}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)}
  \KeywordTok{AS}\NormalTok{ yield }\KeywordTok{FROM} \KeywordTok{share}
      \KeywordTok{ORDER} \KeywordTok{BY}\NormalTok{ shrdiv}\OperatorTok{/}\NormalTok{shrprice}\OperatorTok{*}\DecValTok{100} \KeywordTok{DESC}\NormalTok{;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Run the following code to see the difference.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT}\NormalTok{ shrfirm, shrprice, shrqty, FORMAT(shrdiv}\OperatorTok{/}\NormalTok{shrprice}\OperatorTok{*}\DecValTok{100}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)}
  \KeywordTok{AS}\NormalTok{ yield }\KeywordTok{FROM} \KeywordTok{share}
      \KeywordTok{ORDER} \KeywordTok{BY}\NormalTok{ yield }\KeywordTok{DESC}\NormalTok{;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{data-manipulation}{%
\subsection*{Data manipulation}\label{data-manipulation}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Data manipulation}

SQL supports four DML statements---SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
Most attention is focussed on SELECT because of the variety of ways in
which it can be used. First, we need to understand why we must qualify
column names and temporary names.

\hypertarget{qualifying-column-names}{%
\subsubsection*{Qualifying column names}\label{qualifying-column-names}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Qualifying column names}

Ambiguous references to column names are avoided by qualifying a column
name with its table name, especially when the same column name is used
in several tables. Clarity is maintained by prefixing the column name
with the table name. The following example demonstrates qualification of
the \texttt{natcode}, which appears in both \texttt{stock} and
\texttt{nation}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT}\NormalTok{ stkfirm, stkprice }\KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ stock }\KeywordTok{JOIN}\NormalTok{ nation}
    \KeywordTok{ON}\NormalTok{ stock.natcode }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ nation.natcode;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{select}{%
\subsubsection*{SELECT}\label{select}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{SELECT}

The SELECT statement is by far the most interesting and challenging of
the four DML statements. It reveals a major benefit of the relational
model: powerful interrogation capabilities. It is challenging because
mastering the power of SELECT requires considerable practice with a wide
range of queries. The major varieties of SELECT are presented in this
section.

The general format of SELECT is

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT}\NormalTok{ [}\KeywordTok{DISTINCT}\NormalTok{] item(s) }\KeywordTok{FROM} \KeywordTok{table}\NormalTok{(s)}
\NormalTok{    [}\KeywordTok{WHERE}\NormalTok{ condition]}
\NormalTok{    [}\KeywordTok{GROUP} \KeywordTok{BY} \KeywordTok{column}\NormalTok{(s)] [}\KeywordTok{HAVING}\NormalTok{ condition]}
\NormalTok{    [}\KeywordTok{ORDER} \KeywordTok{BY} \KeywordTok{column}\NormalTok{(s)];}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Alternatively, we can diagram the structure of SELECT.

\emph{Structure of SELECT}

\includegraphics{Figures/Chapter 10/select structure.png}

\hypertarget{product}{%
\subsubsection*{Product}\label{product}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Product}

Product, or more strictly Cartesian product, is a fundamental operation
of relational algebra. It is rarely used by itself in a query; however,
understanding its effect helps in comprehending join. The product of two
tables is a new table consisting of all rows of the first table
concatenated with all possible rows of the second table. For example:

\emph{Form the product of stock and nation.}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \OperatorTok{*} \KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ stock, nation;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Run the query and observe that the new table contains 64 rows (16*4),
where \texttt{stock} has 16 rows and \texttt{nation} has 4 rows. It has
10 columns (7 + 3), where \texttt{stock} has 7 columns and
\texttt{nation} has 3 columns. Note that each row in \texttt{stock} is
concatenated with each row in \texttt{nation}.

\hypertarget{inner-join}{%
\subsubsection*{Inner join}\label{inner-join}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Inner join}

Inner join, often referred to as join, is a powerful and frequently used
operation. It creates a new table from two existing tables by matching
on a column common to both tables. An \textbf{equijoin} is the simplest
form of join; in this case, columns are matched on equality.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \OperatorTok{*} \KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ stock }\KeywordTok{JOIN}\NormalTok{ nation}
    \KeywordTok{ON}\NormalTok{ stock.natcode }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ nation.natcode;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

There are other ways of expressing join that are more concise. For
example, we can write

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \OperatorTok{*} \KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ stock }\KeywordTok{INNER} \KeywordTok{JOIN}\NormalTok{ nation }\KeywordTok{USING}\NormalTok{ (natcode);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The preceding syntax implicitly recognizes the frequent use of the same
column name for matching primary and foreign keys.

A further simplification is to rely on the primary and foreign key
definitions to determine the join condition, so we can write

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \OperatorTok{*} \KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ stock }\KeywordTok{NATURAL} \KeywordTok{JOIN}\NormalTok{ nation;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

An equijoin creates a new table that contains two identical columns. If
one of these is dropped, then the remaining table is called a natural
join.

As you now realize, join can be thought of as a product with a condition
clause. There is no reason why this condition needs to be restricted to
equality. There could easily be another comparison operator between the
two columns. This general version is called a theta-join because theta
is a variable that can take any value from the set `=', `\textless{}',
`\textless=', `\textgreater{}', and `\textgreater='.

An inner join reports those rows where the primary and foreign keys
match. There are also situations where you might want an outer join,
which comes in three flavors as shown in the following figure.

\emph{Types of joins}

\includegraphics{Figures/Chapter 10/joins.png}

A traditional join, more formally known as an inner join, reports those
rows where the primary and foreign keys match. An outer join reports
these matching rows and other rows depending on which form is used, as
the following examples illustrate for the sample table.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lllll@{}}
\toprule()
t1 & & & t2 & \\
\midrule()
\endhead
id & col1 & & id & col2 \\
1 & a & & 1 & x \\
2 & b & & 3 & y \\
3 & c & & 5 & z \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

A \textbf{left outer join} is an inner join plus those rows from t1 not
included in the inner join.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \KeywordTok{id}\NormalTok{, col1, col2 }\KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ t1 }\KeywordTok{LEFT} \KeywordTok{JOIN}\NormalTok{ t2 }\KeywordTok{USING}\NormalTok{ (}\KeywordTok{id}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule()
id & col1 & col2 \\
\midrule()
\endhead
1 & a & x \\
2 & b & null \\
3 & c & y \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

Here is an example to illustrate the use of a left join.

\emph{For all brown items, report each sale. Include in the report those
brown items that have appeared in no sales.}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT}\NormalTok{ itemname, saleno, lineqty }\KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ item}
    \KeywordTok{LEFT} \KeywordTok{JOIN}\NormalTok{ lineitem }\KeywordTok{USING}\NormalTok{ (itemno)}
        \KeywordTok{WHERE}\NormalTok{ itemcolor }\OperatorTok{=} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Brown\textquotesingle{}}
        \KeywordTok{ORDER} \KeywordTok{BY}\NormalTok{ itemname;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

A \textbf{right outer join} is an inner join plus those rows from t2 not
included in the inner join.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \KeywordTok{id}\NormalTok{, col1, col2 }\KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ t1 }\KeywordTok{RIGHT} \KeywordTok{JOIN}\NormalTok{ t2 }\KeywordTok{USING}\NormalTok{ (}\KeywordTok{id}\NormalTok{);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule()
Id & col1 & col2 \\
\midrule()
\endhead
1 & a & x \\
3 & c & y \\
5 & null & z \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

A \textbf{full outer join} is an inner join plus those rows from t1 and
t2 not included in the inner join.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \KeywordTok{id}\NormalTok{, col1, col2 }\KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ t1 }\KeywordTok{FULL} \KeywordTok{JOIN}\NormalTok{ t2 }\KeywordTok{USING}\NormalTok{ (}\KeywordTok{id}\NormalTok{);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule()
id & col1 & col2 \\
\midrule()
\endhead
1 & a & x \\
2 & b & null \\
3 & c & y \\
5 & null & z \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

MySQL does not support a full outer join, rather you must use a union of
left and right outer joins.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \KeywordTok{id}\NormalTok{, col1, col2 }\KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ t1 }\KeywordTok{LEFT} \KeywordTok{JOIN}\NormalTok{ t2 }\KeywordTok{USING}\NormalTok{ (}\KeywordTok{id}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{UNION}
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \KeywordTok{id}\NormalTok{, col1, col2 }\KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ t1 }\KeywordTok{RIGHT} \KeywordTok{JOIN}\NormalTok{ t2 }\KeywordTok{USING}\NormalTok{ (}\KeywordTok{id}\NormalTok{);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{simple-subquery}{%
\subsubsection*{Simple subquery}\label{simple-subquery}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Simple subquery}

A subquery is a query within a query. There is a SELECT statement nested
inside another SELECT statement. Simple subqueries were used extensively
in earlier chapters. For reference, here is a simple subquery used
earlier:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT}\NormalTok{ stkfirm }\KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ stock}
    \KeywordTok{WHERE}\NormalTok{ natcode }\KeywordTok{IN}
\NormalTok{        (}\KeywordTok{SELECT}\NormalTok{ natcode }\KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ nation}
            \KeywordTok{WHERE}\NormalTok{ natname }\OperatorTok{=} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Australia\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{aggregate-functions-1}{%
\subsubsection*{Aggregate functions}\label{aggregate-functions-1}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Aggregate functions}

SQL's aggregate functions increase its retrieval power. These functions
were covered earlier and are only mentioned briefly here for
completeness. The five aggregate functions are shown in the following
table. Nulls in the column are ignored in the case of SUM, AVG, MAX, and
MIN. COUNT(*) does not distinguish between null and non-null values in a
column. Use COUNT(columnname) to exclude a null value in columnname.

\emph{Aggregate functions}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule()
Function & Description \\
\midrule()
\endhead
COUNT & Counts the number of values in a column \\
SUM & Sums the values in a column \\
AVG & Determines the average of the values in a column \\
MAX & Determines the largest value in a column \\
MIN & Determines the smallest value in a column \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

\hypertarget{group-by-and-having}{%
\subsubsection*{GROUP BY and HAVING}\label{group-by-and-having}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{GROUP BY and HAVING}

The GROUP BY clause is an elementary form of control break reporting and
supports grouping of rows that have the same value for a specified
column and produces one row for each different value of the grouping
column. For example,

\emph{Report by nation the total value of stockholdings.}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT}\NormalTok{ natname, }\FunctionTok{SUM}\NormalTok{(stkprice}\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{stkqty}\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{exchrate) }\KeywordTok{AS}\NormalTok{ total}
    \KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ stock }\KeywordTok{JOIN}\NormalTok{ nation }\KeywordTok{ON}\NormalTok{ stock.natcode }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ nation.natcode}
        \KeywordTok{GROUP} \KeywordTok{BY}\NormalTok{ natname;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The HAVING clause is often associated with GROUP BY. It can be thought
of as the WHERE clause of GROUP BY because it is used to eliminate rows
for a GROUP BY condition. Both GROUP BY and HAVING are dealt with
in-depth in Chapter 4.

\hypertarget{regexp}{%
\subsubsection*{REGEXP}\label{regexp}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{REGEXP}

The REGEXP clause supports pattern matching to find a defined set of
strings in a character column (CHAR or VARCHAR). Refer to Chapters 3 and
4 for more details.

\hypertarget{universal-unique-identifier-uuid}{%
\subsection*{Universal Unique Identifier
(UUID)}\label{universal-unique-identifier-uuid}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Universal Unique Identifier (UUID)}

A \textbf{Universally Unique Identifier} (UUID) is a generated number
that is globally unique even if generated by independent programs on
different computers. The~probability~that a UUID is not unique is close
enough to zero to be negligible. More precisely, the probability of a
duplicate within 103 trillion UUIDs is one in a billion.

A UUID is a 128-bit number generated by combining a timestamp and the
generating computers's node id to create an identifier that it
temporally and spatially different. A UUID is useful when you want to
support different programs on different computers inserting rows in a
distributed database.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT}\NormalTok{ UUID() }\KeywordTok{AS}\NormalTok{ UUID\_Value;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{nullsmuch-ado-about-missing-information}{%
\subsection*{Nulls---much ado about missing
information}\label{nullsmuch-ado-about-missing-information}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Nulls---much ado about missing
information}

Nulls are overworked in SQL because they can represent several
situations. Null can represent unknown information. For example, you
might add a new stock to the database, but lacking details of its latest
dividend, you leave the field null. Null can be used to represent a
value that is inapplicable. For instance, the employee table contains a
null value in bossno for Alice because she has no boss. The value is not
unknown; it is not applicable for that field. In other cases, null might
mean ``no value supplied'' or ``value undefined.'' Because null can have
multiple meanings, the client must infer which meaning is appropriate to
the circumstances.

Do not confuse null with blank or zero, which are values. In fact, null
is a marker that specifies that the value for the particular column is
null. Thus, null represents no value.

The well-known database expert Chris Date has been outspoken in his
concern about the confusion caused by nulls. His advice is that nulls
should be explicitly avoided by specifying NOT NULL for all columns and
by using codes to make the meaning of a value clear (e.g., ``U'' means
``unknown,'' ``I'' means ``inapplicable,'' and ``N'' means ``not
supplied'').

\hypertarget{the-future-of-sql}{%
\subsection*{The future of SQL}\label{the-future-of-sql}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The future of SQL}

Since 1986, developers of database applications have benefited from an
SQL standard, one of the more successful standardization stories in the
software industry. Although most database vendors have implemented
proprietary extensions of SQL, standardization has kept the language
consistent, and SQL code is highly portable. Standardization was
relatively easy when focused on the storage and retrieval of numbers and
characters. Objects have made standardization more difficult.

\hypertarget{summary-3}{%
\subsubsection*{Summary}\label{summary-3}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Summary}

Structured Query Language (SQL), a widely used relational database
language, has been adopted as a standard by ANSI and ISO. It is a data
definition language (DDL), data manipulation language (DML), and data
control language (DCL).

A base table is an autonomous, named table. A key is one or more columns
identified as such in the description of a table or a referential
constraint. SQL supports primary, foreign, and unique keys.

Numeric, string, date, or graphic data can be stored in a column. BLOB
and CLOB are data types for large fields.

Ambiguous references to column names are avoided by qualifying a column
name with its table name. A table or view can be given a temporary name
that remains current for a query.

SELECT provides powerful interrogation facilities. The product of two
tables is a new table consisting of all rows of the first table
concatenated with all possible rows of the second table. Join creates a
new table from two existing tables by matching on a column common to
both tables. A subquery is a query within a query.

SQL's aggregate functions increase its retrieval power. GROUP BY
supports grouping of rows that have the same value for a specified
column. The REXEXP clause supports pattern matching. SQL includes scalar
functions that can be used in arithmetic expressions, data conversion,
or data extraction. Nulls cause problems because they can represent
several situations---unknown information, inapplicable information, no
value supplied, or value undefined. Remember, a null is not a blank or
zero.
