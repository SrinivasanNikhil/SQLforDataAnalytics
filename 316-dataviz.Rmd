### Learning objectives {.unnumbered}

Students completing this chapter will:

-   Understand the principles of the grammar of graphics;

-   Be able to use ggvis to create common business graphics;

-   Be able to select data from a database for graphic creation;

-   Be able to depict locations on a Google map.

## Visual processing {.unnumbered}

Humans are particularly skilled at processing visual information because
it is an innate capability, compared to reading which is a learned
skill. When we evolved on the Savannah of Africa, we had to be adept at
processing visual information (e.g., recognizing danger) and deciding on
the right course of action (fight or flight). Our ancestors were those
who were efficient visual processors and quickly detected threats and
used this information to make effective decisions. They selected actions
that led to survival. Those who were inefficient visual information
processors did not survive to reproduce. Even those with good visual
skills failed to propagate if they made poor decisions relative to
detected dangers. Consequently, we should seek opportunities to present
information visually and play to our evolved strength. As people vary in
their preference for visual and textual information, it often makes
sense to support both types of reporting.

In order to learn how to visualize data, you need to become familiar
with the grammar of graphics and ggvis (an R extension for graphics). In
line with the learning of data modeling and SQL, we will take an
intertwined spiral approach. First we will tackle the grammar of
graphics (the abstract) and then move to ggvis (the concrete). You will
also learn how to take the output of an SQL query and feed it directly
into ggvis. The end result will be a comprehensive set of practical
skills for data visualization.

## The grammar of graphics {.unnumbered}

A grammar is a system of rules for generating valid statements in a
language. A grammar makes it possible for people to communicate
accurately and concisely. English has a rather complex grammar, as do
most languages. In contrast, computer-related languages, such as SQL,
have a relatively simple grammar because they are carefully designed for
expressive power, consistency, and ease of use. Each of the dialects of
data modeling also has a grammar, and each of these grammars is quite
similar in that they all have the same foundational elements: entities,
attributes, identifiers, and relationships.

A grammar has been designed by Wilkinson[^dataviz-1] for creating graphics to
enhance their expressiveness and comprehensiveness. From a mathematical
perspective, a graph is a set of points. A graphic is a physical
representation of a graph. Thus, a graph can have many physical
representations, and one of the skills you need to gain is to be able to
judge what is a meaningful graphic for your clients. A grammar for
graphics provides you with many ways of creating a graphic, just as the
grammar of English gives you many ways of writing a sentence. Of course,
we differ in our ability to convey information in English. Similarly, we
also differ in our skills in representing a graph in a visual format.
The aesthetic attributes of a graph determine its ability to convey
information. For a graphic, aesthetics are specified by elements such as
size and color. One of the most applauded graphics is Minard's drawing
in 1861 of Napoleon's advance on and retreat from Russia during 1812.
The dominating aspect of the graphic is the dwindling size of the French
army as it battled winter, disease, and the Russian army. The graph
shows the size of the army, its location, and the direction of its
movement. The temperature during the retreat is drawn at the bottom of
graphic.

[^dataviz-1]: Wilkinson, L. (2005). \*The grammar of graphics\* (2nd ed.). New
    York: Springer.

*Charles Joseph Minard's graphic of Napoleon's Russian expedition in
1812*

![](Figures/Chapter%2016/Charles-Joseph-Minard.png)

Wilkinson's grammar is based on six elements:

1.  *Data*: a set of data operations that creates variables from
    datasets;

2.  *Trans*: variable transformations;

3.  *Scale*: scale transformations;

4.  *Coord*: a coordinate system;

5.  *Element*: a graph and its aesthetic attributes;

6.  *Guide*: one or more guides.

Interest in the grammar of data visualization has increased in recent
years because of the growth in data. There is ongoing search to find
ways to reveal clearly the information in large data sets. Vega[^dataviz-2] is a
recent formulation building on Wilkinson's work. In Vega, a
visualization consists of basic properties of a graph (such as the width
and height) and definitions of the data to visualize, scales for mapping
to data to a visual form, axes for representing scales, and graphic
marks (such as rectangles, circles, and arcs) for displaying the data.

[^dataviz-2]: <http://trifacta.github.io/vega/>

## ggvis {.unnumbered}

ggvis is an implementation of Vega in R Because it is based on a
grammar, ggvis is a very powerful graphics tool for creating both simple
and complex graphs. It is well-suited for generating multi-layered
graphs because of its grammatical foundation. As a result, using ggvis
you specify a series of steps (think of them as sentences) to create a
graphic (think of it as a paragraph) to visually convey your message.
ggvis is a descendant of ggplot2 and adds new features to support
interactive visualization using shiny, another R package, which we will
cover later.

### Data {.unnumbered}

Most structured data, which is what we require for graphing, are
typically stored in spreadsheets or databases. In the prior chapter
introducing R, you learned how to read a spreadsheet exported as a CSV
file and access a database. These are also the skills you need for
reading a file containing data to be visualized.

### Transformation {.unnumbered}

A transformation converts data into a format suitable for the intended
visualization. In this case, we want to depict the relative change in
carbon levels since pre-industrial periods, when the value was 280 ppm.
Here are sample R commands.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
# compute a new column in carbon containing the relative change in CO2
carbon$relCO2 = (carbon$CO2-280)/280
```

There are many ways that you might want to transform data. The preceding
example just illustrates the general nature of a transformation. You can
also think of SQL as a transformation process as it can compute new
values from existing columns.

### Coord {.unnumbered}

A coordinate system describes where things are located. A geopositioning
system (GPS ) reading of latitude and longitude describes where you are
on the surface of the globe. It is typically layered onto a map so you
can see where you are relative to your current location. Most graphs are
plotted on a two-dimensional (2D) grid with x (horizontal) and y
(vertical) coordinates. ggvis currently supports six 2D coordinate
systems, as shown in the following table. The default coordinate system
for most packages is Cartesian.

*Coordinate systems*

| Name      | Description                       |
|:----------|:----------------------------------|
| cartesian | Cartesian coordinates             |
| equal     | Equal scale Cartesian coordinates |
| flip      | Flipped Cartesian coordinates     |
| trans     | Transformed Cartesian coordinates |
| map       | Map projections                   |
| polar     | Polar coordinates                 |

### Element {.unnumbered}

An element is a graph and its attributes. Let's start with a simple
scatterplot of year against CO~2~ emissions. We do this in two steps
applying the ggvis approach of building a graphic by adding layers.
ggvis uses the pipe function to specify a linear sequence of processing.

-   The foundation is the ggvis function, which identifies the source of
    the data and what is to be plotted. In the following example, the
    file carbon is fed into the ggvis function, which selects year and
    CO2 as the x and y, respectively, dimensions of the graph

-   A graph consists of a number of layers, and in the following example
    the points layer receives the x and y values from ggvis and plots
    each pair of points with a red dot.

```{r, message = TRUE}
library(ggvis)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
url <- 'http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/carbon.txt'
carbon <- read_delim(url, delim=',')
# Select year(x) and CO2(y) to create a x-y point plot
# Specify red points, as you find that aesthetically pleasing
carbon %>% 
  ggvis(~year,~CO2) %>% 
  layer_points(fill:='red')
# Notice how ‘%>%’ is used for creating a pipeline of commands
```

Graphics appear under the Plots tab of the bottom right window. You can
select the Export tab to save a graphic to a file or the clipboard.
Also, notice that you can use left and right arrows of the Plots tab to
cycle through graphics created in a session.

### Scale {.unnumbered}

Scales control the visualization of data. It is usually a good idea to
have a zero point for the y axis so you don't distort the slope of the
line. In the following example, the scale_numeric functionspecifies a
zero point for the y axis with the command zero=T.

```{r, message = TRUE}
carbon %>% 
  ggvis(~year,~CO2) %>% 
  layer_points(fill:='red') %>% 
  scale_numeric('y',zero=T)
```

### Axes and legends {.unnumbered}

Axes and legends are both forms of guides, which help the reader to
understand a graphic. Readability enhancers such as axes, title, and
tick marks are generated automatically based on the parameters specified
in the ggvis command. You can override the defaults.

Let's redo the graphic with the relative change since the beginning of
industrialization in the mid 18th century, when the level of CO2 was
around 280 ppm. This time, we will create a line plot. We also add some
titles for the axes and specify a format of four consecutive digits for
displaying a year on the x-axis. We also move or offset the title for
the y-axis a bit to the left to improve readability.

```{r, message = TRUE}
# compute a new column containing the relative change in CO2
carbon %>% 
  mutate(relCO2 = (CO2-280)/280) %>% # transformation
  ggvis(~year,~relCO2) %>% 
  layer_lines(stroke:="blue") %>% 
  scale_numeric('y',zero=T) %>% 
  add_axis('y', title = "CO2 ppm of the atmosphere", title_offset=50) %>% 
  add_axis('x', title ='Year', format='####')
```

As the prior graphic shows, the present level of CO~2~ in the atmosphere
is now above 40 percent higher than the pre-industrial period and is
continuing to grow.

#### Assignment function {.unnumbered}

You will have seen three types of assignment symbols in the preceding
examples. The notion of scaling helps in understanding the difference
between a value and a property. A property is fixed. So no matter how
you resize the preceding graph, the stroke will always be blue. Whereas,
a value, such as the title, is scalable. The difference between a value
and a property can seem confusing, so don't agonize over it.

| Symbol |                 | Example          |                    |
|:-------|-----------------|:-----------------|--------------------|
| \~     | Data assignment | y \~ CO2         | y is CO2 column    |
| =      | Set a value     | title = 'year'   | Title is scaled    |
| :=     | Set a property  | stroke := 'blue' | Stroke is unscaled |

### Guides {.unnumbered}

Axes and legends are both forms of guides, which help the reader to
understand a graphic. In ggvis, legends and axes are generated
automatically based on the parameters specified in the ggvis command.
You have the capability to override the defaults for axes, but the
legend is quite fixed in its format.

In the following graphic, for each axis there is a label and there are
tick marks with values so that you eyeball a point on the graphic for
its x and y values. The legend enables you to determine which color, in
this case, matches each year. A legend could also use shape (e.g., a
diamond) and shape size to aid matching.

## Some recipes {.unnumbered}

Learning the full power of ggvis is quite an undertaking, so here are a
few recipes for visualizing data.

### Histogram {.unnumbered}

Histograms are useful for showing the distribution of values in a single
column. A histogram has a vertical orientation. The number of
occurrences of a particular value in a column are automatically counted
by the ggvis function. In the following sample code, we show the
distribution of temperatures in Celsius for the Central Park temperature
data. Notice that the Celsius conversion is rounded to an integer for
plotting. Width specifies the size of the bin, which is two in this
case. This means that the bin above the tick mark 10 contains all values
in the range 9 to 11. There is online a list of names of colors you can
use in ggvis.[^dataviz-3]

[^dataviz-3]: <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colornames.asp>

```{r, message = TRUE}
library(ggvis)
library(readr)
library(measurements)
url <-  'http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/centralparktemps.txt'
t <- read_delim(url, delim=',')
t %>% 
  mutate(Celsius = conv_unit(t$temperature,'F','C')) %>%
  ggvis(~Celsius) %>% 
  layer_histograms(width = 2, fill:='cornflowerblue') %>%
add_axis('x',title='Celsius') %>% 
  add_axis('y',title='Frequency')
```

### Bar graph {.unnumbered}

In the following example, we query a database to get data for plotting.
Because the column selected for graphing, productLine is categorical, we
need to use a bar graph.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(ggvis)
library(DBI)
conn <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), "www.richardtwatson.com", dbname="ClassicModels", user="student", password="student")
# Query the database and create file for use with R
d <- dbGetQuery(conn,"SELECT * from Products;") 
# Plot the number of product lines by specifying the appropriate column name
d %>% 
  ggvis(~productLine) %>% 
  layer_bars(fill:='chocolate') %>%
  add_axis('x',title='Product line') %>% 
  add_axis('y',title='Count')
```

> ❓**Skill builder**
>
> Create a bar graph using the data in the following table. Set
> population as the weight for each observation.
>
> | year                  | 1804 | 1927 | 1960 | 1974 | 1987 | 1999 | 2012 | 2027 | 2046 |
> |:----------------------|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
> | population (billions) | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    |

### Scatterplot {.unnumbered}

A scatterplot shows points on an x-y grid, which means you need to have
an x and y with numeric values.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(ggvis)
library(DBI)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
conn <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), "www.richardtwatson.com", dbname="ClassicModels", user="student", password="student")
o <- dbGetQuery(conn,"SELECT * FROM Orders") 
od <- dbGetQuery(conn,"SELECT * FROM OrderDetails")
d <- inner_join(o,od)
# Get the monthly value of orders
d2 <- d %>% 
  mutate(month = month(orderDate)) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% summarize(orderValue = sum(quantityOrdered*priceEach))
# Plot data orders by month
# Show the points and the line
d2 %>% 
  ggvis(~month, ~orderValue/1000000) %>%  
  layer_lines(stroke:='blue') %>%
  layer_points(fill:='red') %>%
  add_axis('x', title = 'Month') %>%
  add_axis('y',title='Order value (millions)', title_offset=30)
```

It is sometimes helpful to show multiple scatterplots on the one grid.
In ggvis, you can create groups of points for plotting. Sometimes, you
might find it convenient to recode data so you can use different colors
or lines to distinguish values in set categories. Let's examine grouping
by year.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(ggvis)
library(DBI)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
conn <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), "www.richardtwatson.com", dbname="ClassicModels", user="student", password="student")
o <- dbGetQuery(conn,"SELECT * FROM Orders") 
od <- dbGetQuery(conn,"SELECT * FROM OrderDetails")
d <- inner_join(o,od)
d2 <- d %>% 
  mutate(month = month(orderDate)) %>% 
  mutate(year = year(orderDate)) %>% 
  group_by(year,month) %>% summarize(orderValue = sum(quantityOrdered*priceEach))
# Plot data orders by month and display by year
# ggvis expects grouping variables to be a factor
d2 %>% 
  ggvis(~month,~orderValue/1000, stroke = ~as.factor(year)) %>%
  layer_lines() %>% 
  add_axis('x', title = 'Month') %>%
  add_axis('y',title='Order value (thousands)', title_offset=50)
```

Because ggvis is based on a grammar of graphics, with a few changes, you
can create a bar graph of the same data.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
d2 %>% 
  ggvis( ~month, ~orderValue/100000, fill = ~as.factor(year)) %>% 
  layer_bars() %>% 
  add_axis('x', title = 'Month') %>%
  add_axis('y',title='Order value (thousands)', title_offset=50) 
```

Sometimes the data that you want to graph will be in multiple files.
Here is a case where we want to show ClassicCars orders and payments by
month on the same plot.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(ggvis)
library(DBI)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
# Load the driver
conn <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), "www.richardtwatson.com", dbname="ClassicModels", user="student", password="student")
o <- dbGetQuery(conn,"SELECT * FROM Orders") 
od <- dbGetQuery(conn,"SELECT * FROM OrderDetails")
d <- inner_join(o,od)
d2 <- 
  d %>% 
  mutate(month = month(orderDate)) %>% 
  mutate(year = year(orderDate)) %>% 
  filter(year == 2004) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarize(value = sum(quantityOrdered*priceEach))
d2$category <- 'Orders'
p <-  dbGetQuery(conn,"SELECT * from Payments;")
p2 <- p %>% 
  mutate(month = month(paymentDate)) %>% 
  mutate(year = year(paymentDate)) %>% 
  filter(year==2004) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarize(value = sum(amount))
p2$category <- 'Payments'
m <- rbind(d2,p2) # bind by rows
m %>% 
  group_by(category) %>% 
  ggvis(~month, ~value, stroke = ~ category) %>% 
  layer_lines() %>% 
  add_axis('x',title='Month') %>% 
  add_axis('y',title='Value',title_offset=70)  
```

### Smoothing {.unnumbered}

Smoothing helps to detect a trend in a line plot. The following example
shows the average mean temperatures for August for Central Park.

```{r, message = TRUE}
library(ggvis)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
url <-  "http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/centralparktemps.txt"
t <- read_delim(url, delim=',')
t %>% 
  filter(month == 8) %>% 
  ggvis(~year,~temperature) %>% 
  layer_lines(stroke:='red') %>% 
  layer_smooths(se=T, stroke:='blue') %>%
  add_axis('x',title='Year',format = '####') %>% 
  add_axis('y',title='Temperature (F)', title_offset=30)
```

> ❓**Skill builder** Using the Central Park data, plot the temperatures
> for February and fit a straight line to the points. Use
> layer_model_predictions(). What do you observe?

### Box Plot {.unnumbered}

A box plot is an effective means of displaying information about one or
more variables. It shows minimum and maximum, range, lower quartile,
median, and upper quartile for each variable. The following code creates
a box plot for a single variable. Notice that we use factor(0) to
indicate there is no grouping variable.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(ggvis)
library(DBI)
conn <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), "www.richardtwatson.com", dbname="ClassicModels", user="student", password="student")
d <- dbGetQuery(conn,"SELECT * from Payments;")
# Boxplot of amounts paid
d %>% 
  ggvis(~factor(0),~amount) %>% 
  layer_boxplots() %>%
  add_axis('x',title='Checks') %>% 
  add_axis('y',title='')
```

The following example shows a box plot for each month. Notice how to
indicate the values for each of the ticks for the x-axis. Try running
the code without the values specification.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(ggvis)
library(DBI)
library(lubridate)
conn <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), "www.richardtwatson.com", dbname="ClassicModels", user="student", password="student")
d <- dbGetQuery(conn,"SELECT * from Payments;")
# Boxplot of amounts paid
d %>% 
  mutate(month = month(paymentDate)) %>% 
  ggvis(~month,~amount) %>% 
  layer_boxplots() %>%
  add_axis('x',title='Month', values=c(1:12)) %>%
  add_axis('y',title='Amount', title_offset=70)
```

### Heat map {.unnumbered}

A heat map visualizes tabular data. It is useful when you have two
categorical variables cross tabulated. Consider the case for the
ClassicModels database where we want to get an idea of the different
number of model scales in each product line. We can get a quick picture
with the following code.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(ggvis)
library(DBI)
library(dplyr)
# Load the driver
conn <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), "www.richardtwatson.com", dbname="ClassicModels", user="student", password="student")
d <- dbGetQuery(conn,'SELECT * FROM Products;')
d2 <- 
  d %>% 
  group_by(productLine, productScale) %>% 
  summarize(frequency = n())
d2 %>% 
  ggvis( ~productScale, ~productLine, fill= ~frequency) %>% 
  layer_rects(width = band(), height = band()) %>%
  add_axis('y',title='Product Line', title_offset=70) %>% 
  # add frequency to each cell
  layer_text(text:=~frequency, stroke:='white', align:='left', baseline:='top')
```

## Interactive graphics {.unnumbered}

The ggvis package incorporates features of shiny, an R package, that
enable you to create interactive graphics. For example, you might want
to let the viewer select the color and width of a line on a graphic.
Many of the interactive controls, shown in the following table, should
be familiar as the the various options are often used for web forms.

*Interactive controls for ggvis*

| Function              | Purpose                          |
|:----------------------|:---------------------------------|
| input_checkbox()      | Check one or more boxes          |
| input_checkboxgroup() | A group of checkboxes            |
| input_numeric()       | A spin box                       |
| input_radiobuttons()  | Pick one from a set of options   |
| input_select()        | Select from a drop-down text box |
| input_slider()        | Select using a slider            |
| input_text()          | Input text                       |

### Selecting a property using a drop-down list {.unnumbered}

The following example uses the input_select function to present the
viewer with an option of one of three colors (red, green, or blue) for
the stroke of the graph. When you execute the code, you will see a
selection list on the left bottom. Because the graph is interactive, you
will need to click on the stop button (top right of the Viewer window)
before running anymore R commands.

```{r, message = TRUE}
library(shiny)
library(ggvis)
library(dplyr)
carbon %>% 
  mutate(relCO2 = (CO2-280)/280) %>% 
  ggvis(~year,~relCO2) %>%
  layer_lines(stroke:=input_select(c("red", "green", "blue"))) %>% 
  scale_numeric('y',zero=T) %>% 
  add_axis('y', title = "CO2 ppm of the atmosphere", title_offset=50) %>% 
  add_axis('x', title ='Year', format='####')
```

> ❓**Skill builder**
>
> Create a point plot using the data in the following table. Give the
> viewer a choice of three colors and three shapes (square, cross, or
> diamond) for the points.
>
> | year                  | 1804 | 1927 | 1960 | 1974 | 1987 | 1999 | 2012 | 2027 | 2046 |
> |:----------------------|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
> | population (billions) | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    |

### Selecting a numeric value with a slider {.unnumbered}

A slider enables the viewer to select a numeric value in a range. In the
following code, a slider is set up for values between 1 to 5,
inclusively. Note in this case, the stroke width slider and color
selector are defined outside the ggvis code. This is a useful technique
for writing code that makes it possible for some chunks to be easily
reused

```{r, message = TRUE}
slider <- input_slider(1, 5, label = "Width")
select_color <- input_select(label='Color',c("red", "green", "blue")) 
carbon %>% 
  mutate(relCO2 = (CO2-280)/280) %>% 
  ggvis(~year,~relCO2) %>% 
  layer_lines(stroke:=select_color, strokeWidth:=slider) %>%
  scale_numeric('y',zero=T) %>% 
  add_axis('y', title = "CO2 ppm of the atmosphere", title_offset=50) %>% 
  add_axis('x', title ='Year', format='####')
```

> ❓**Skill builder** Using the Central Park data, plot the temperatures
> for a selected year using a slider.

## Geographic data {.unnumbered}

The ggmap package supports a variety of mapping systems, including
Google maps. As you might expect, it offers many features, and we just
touch on the basics in this example.

The Offices table in the Classic Models database includes the latitude
and longitude of each office in officeLocation, which has a datatype of
POINT. The following R code can be used to mark each office on a Google
map. After loading the required packages, a database query is executed
to return the longitude and latitude for each office. Then, a Google map
of the United States is displayed. The marker parameter specifies the
name of the table containing the values for longitude and latitude.
Offices that are not in the U.S. (e.g., Sydney) are ignored. Adjust
zoom, an integer, to get a suitably sized map. Zoom can range from 3 (a
continent) to 20 (a building).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Google now requires an API key
library(ggplot2)
library(ggmap)
library(mapproj)
# Google maps requires lon and lat, in that order, to create markers
d <- dbGetQuery(conn,"SELECT ST_Y(officeLocation) AS lon, ST_X(officeLocation) AS lat FROM Offices;")
# show offices in the United States
# vary zoom to change the size of the map
map <-  get_googlemap('united states',marker=d,zoom=4)
ggmap(map) + labs(x = 'Longitude', y = 'Latitude') + ggtitle('US offices')

## R resources {.unnumbered}

The developer of ggvis, Hadley Wickham, maintains a [[web
site]{.ul}](http://ggvis.rstudio.com). Another useful web site for data
visualization is [[FlowingData]{.ul}](http://flowingdata.com), which has
an associated book, titled *Visualize This*. If you become heavily
involved in visualization, we suggest you read some of the works of
Edward Tufte. One of his books is listed in the references.

## Summary {.unnumbered}

Because of evolutionary pressure, humans became strong visual
processors. Consequently, graphics can be very effective for presenting
information. The grammar of graphics provides a logical foundation for
the construction of a graphic by adding successive layers of
information. ggvis is a package implementing the grammar of graphics in
R, the open source statistics platform. Data can be extracted from an
MySQL database for processing and graphical presentation in R. Spatial
data can be selected from a database and displayed on a Google map.

## Exercises {.unnumbered}

1.  Given the following data on the world's cargo carrying capacity in
    millions of dead weight tons (dwt)[^dataviz-4] for the given years, graph
    the relationship as a point plot. Add a linear prediction model to
    the graph. What is the approximate increase in the world capacity
    each year?

[^dataviz-4]: Dead weight tonnage is a measure of how much weight, in tonnes, a
    ship can safely carry.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dwt <- c(2566, 3704, 4008, 5984, 7700, 8034, 8229, 7858, 8408, 8939)
year <- c(1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011)
```

2.  Create a bar graph showing the relative ocean shipping cost as a
    percentage of total cost for some common household items using the
    following data.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
unitCost <-  c(700, 200, 150, 50, 15, 3, 1)
shipCost <-  c(10.00, 1.50, 1.00, 0.15, 0.15, 0.05, 0.01)
item <-  c('TV set', 'DVD player', 'Vacuum cleaner', 'Scotch whisky', 'Coffee', 'Biscuits', 'Beer')
```

*SQL input*

3.  Visualize in blue the number of items for each product scale.

4.  Prepare a line plot with appropriate labels for total payments for
    each month in 2004.

5.  Create a histogram with appropriate labels for the value of orders
    received from the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway,
    Sweden).

6.  Create a heatmap for product lines and Norwegian cities.

7.  Show on a Google map the customers in Japan.

8.  Show on a Google map the European customers who have never placed an
    order.

*File input*

9.  Access
    [[http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/manheim.txt]{.ul}](http://people.terry.uga.edu/rwatson/data/manheim.txt),
    which contains details of the sales of three car models: X, Y,
    and Z.

    a.  Create a bar chart for sales of each model (X, Y , or Z)

    b.  Create bar chart for sales by each form of sale (online or
        auction).

10. Use the 'Import Dataset' feature of RStudio to read
    [[http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/electricityprices.csv]{.ul}](http://people.terry.uga.edu/rwatson/data/electricityprices.csv),
    which contains details of electricity prices for a major city.[^dataviz-5]
    Do a Box plot of cost. What do you conclude about cost?

11. Read the table
    [[http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/wealth.csv]{.ul}](http://people.terry.uga.edu/rwatson/data/wealth.csv)
    containing details of the wealth of various countries. Create
    histograms for each of the wealth measures. Consult the ggvis color
    chart[^dataviz-6] for a choice of colors.

12. Merge the data for weather
    \<[[http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/weather.csv]{.ul}](http://people.terry.uga.edu/rwatson/data/weather.csv)\>
    and electricity prices
    \<[[http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/electricityprices.csv]{.ul}](http://people.terry.uga.edu/rwatson/data/electricityprices.csv)\>
    for a major city. The merged file should contain air temperature and
    electricity cost. Also, you need to convert air temperature from a
    factor to a numeric (hint: first convert to a character). As readr
    does not currently handle date and time stamps, use the following
    code to read the files.

[^dataviz-5]: Note these prices have been transformed from the original values,
    but are still representative of the changes over time.

[^dataviz-6]: <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colornames.asp>

```{r, eval = FALSE}
wurl <-  'http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/weather.csv'
w <-  read.csv(wurl,sep=',',header=T)
eurl <-  'http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/electricityprices.csv'
e <-  read.csv(eurl,sep=',',header=T)
```

    a. Compute the correlation between temperature and electricity price.
       What do you conclude?

    b. Graph the relationship between temperature and electricity price.

    c. Graph the relationship between temperature and electricity price
       when the temperature is 95ºF and above.

    d. Create a single graph showing the relationship between temperature
       and electricity price differentiating by color when the temperature
       is above or below 90ºF. (Hint: Trying recoding temperature).
